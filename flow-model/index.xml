We assume a cylindrical design will be used with a converging-diverging throat, as shown above in Figure 5.1.1. The analysis begins by determining the cross-sectional area of the throat (Station 33.</description>

      <description>MathJax = { tex: {inlineMath: [[&#39;$&#39;, &#39;$&#39;], [&#39;\\(&#39;, &#39;\\)&#39;]]} };  In the previous section we defined the geometry of the LTMCC, at times using some &amp;ldquo;rather arbitrary&amp;rdquo; rules of thumb. This was acceptable because the subsonic portion of the LTMCC is relatively tolerant to gradual changes in geometry. This is not the case in the supersonic portion of the LTMCC and nozzle downstream of the throat. In this region we must turn to a more rigorous approach to minimize separation and turbulent losses.</description>

      <description>MathJax = { tex: {inlineMath: [[&#39;$&#39;, &#39;$&#39;], [&#39;\\(&#39;, &#39;\\)&#39;]]} };  Sections 5.1 and 5.2 define the geometry of the SSME combustion chamber and nozzle. The analysis in Section 4.5  provides the temperature, pressure, and composition of the gas inside the chamber. Now we will use this information to predict what happens to the combustion products as they depart the LTMCC and accelerate toward the nozzle exit plane.</description>
