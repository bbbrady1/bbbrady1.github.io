Route high-pressure hydrogen to the engine’s three combustion chambers. b. Route cryogenic hydrogen to regeneratively cool the walls of the combustion chambers and the nozzle jacket. Liquid hydrogen enters the Low Pressure Fuel Turbopump (Station 1) from the External Tank. This pump raises the pressure of the incoming fluid to a modest level before routing it to the High Pressure Fuel Turbopump (HPFTP) at Station 3 where the pressure is raised to a level suitable for combustion. A small quantity of hydrogen (Station 5) flows through the seals of the HPFTP in order to cool the High Pressure Fuel Turbine. After cooling the turbine bearings, this hydrogen is mixed into the combustion gases departing the turbine exit.\nAfter departing the HPFTP at Station 4, the hydrogen flow spits into three branches. Branch “A” runs to the nozzle cooling jacket (Stations 6-7). This heat exchanger consists of 1080 brazed A286 stainless steel tubes running along the length of the nozzle.[67] It ensures the hot exhaust plume does not melt the nozzle wall. Cold hydrogen enters the cooling jacket at Station 6, flows up the nozzle wall, and exits the cooling jacket at Station 7. From here, the flow splits yet again and is routed to the Fuel Preburner Hydrogen Inlet (Station 13) and the Oxidizer Preburner Hydrogen Inlet (Station 14).\nThe second branch departing the HPFTP (Branch “B”) is used to cool the walls of the Large Throat Main Combustion Chamber (LTMCC). Cold hydrogen enters the combustion chamber liner at Station 8. It flows up the walls of the liner through 430 rectangular channels [68] and exits at Station 9. From here the hydrogen is routed to Station 10 in order to drive the Low Pressure Fuel Turbine. The Low Pressure Fuel Turbine powers the Low Pressure Fuel Turbopump, thus sustaining the overall mass flow rate of liquid hydrogen into the system. After departing the Low Pressure Fuel Turbine at Station 11, the flow proceeds to Station 12 where it enters cooling passages designed to regulate the temperature of the Fuel Preburner. Hydrogen flows down these cooling passages all the way to the LTMCC.\nIn a similar manner, a small quantity of hydrogen is utilized to cool the Oxidizer Preburner. Hydrogen branches off from the Oxidizer Preburner Inlet at Station 14 and flows into the Oxidizer Preburner Coolant Passage (Station 15). From here the flow proceeds directly into the LTMCC.\nSome of the hydrogen departing the Low Pressure Fuel Turbine at Station 11 is routed back to the external hydrogen tank to provide ullage pressure (Station 16).\nThe third branch departing the HPFTP (Branch “C”) merges with the outflow from the nozzle cooling jacket (Station 7) and is routed to the Fuel and Oxidizer Preburner Inlets (Stations 13 and 14).\nTable 1.1.1 displays several key thermodynamic properties of the flow as it progresses through these stations. The mass flow rates, temperatures, and pressures listed below were tabulated from Reference [2]. Densities and enthalpies were calculated utilizing the procedure described in Section 2.2.\n\nSI Units  .tg {border-collapse:collapse;border-spacing:0;} .tg td{border-color:black;border-style:solid;border-width:1px;font-family:Arial, sans-serif;font-size:14px; overflow:hidden;padding:10px 5px;word-break:normal;} .tg th{border-color:black;border-style:solid;border-width:1px;font-family:Arial, sans-serif;font-size:14px; font-weight:normal;overflow:hidden;padding:10px 5px;word-break:normal;} .tg .tg-c9n4{background-color:#F99;border-color:inherit;font-weight:bold;text-align:center;vertical-align:middle} .tg .tg-c1bx{background-color:#FF9F9F;border-color:inherit;text-align:center;vertical-align:middle} .tg .tg-8qyp{background-color:#F99;border-color:inherit;text-align:center;vertical-align:middle}    Station Component Mass Flow $kg/s$ Temperature $K$ Pressure $MPa$ Density $\\frac{kg}{m^3}$ Enthalpy $kJ/kg$     1 Low Pressure Fuel Turbopump Inlet 70.3 20.4 0.21 70.38 -4449   2 Low Pressure Fuel Turbopump Exit 70.3 23.7 2.05 69.07 -4412   3 High Pressure Fuel Turbopump Inlet 70.3 23.7 1.72 68.58 -4401   4 High Pressure Fuel Turbopump Exit 67.6 51.5 41.07 78.83 -3749   5 High Pressure Fuel Turbine Coolant 2.7 51.5 41.07 78.82 -3748   6 Nozzle Cooling Jacket Inlet 21.1 51.5 38.78 77.75 -3769   7 Nozzle Cooling Jacket Exit 21.1 330.9 37.37 31.99 -1424   8 Combustion Chamber Liner Inlet 13.2 52.0 38.93 77.57 -3762   9 Combustion Chamber Liner Exit 13.2 264.8 30.62 25.08 -819   10 Low Pressure Fuel Turbine Inlet 13.2 264.8 29.08 24.36 -827   11 Low Pressure Fuel Turbine Exit 13.2 255.4 21.85 21.50 -1001   12 Fuel Pre-Burner Coolant Passages 7.7 255.4 21.85 21.50 -1001   13 Fuel Pre-Burner H2 Inlet 34.9 148.2 36.61 42.42 -2503   14 Oxidizer Pre-Burner H2 Inlet 19.1 148.2 36.61 42.42 -2503   15 Oxidizer Pre-Burner Coolant Passages 5.0 255.4 21.85 21.50 -1001   16 External Hydrogen Tank Ullage Gas Supply 0.5 255.4 21.85 21.50 -1001     English Units  .tg {border-collapse:collapse;border-spacing:0;} .tg td{border-color:black;border-style:solid;border-width:1px;font-family:Arial, sans-serif;font-size:14px; overflow:hidden;padding:10px 5px;word-break:normal;} .tg th{border-color:black;border-style:solid;border-width:1px;font-family:Arial, sans-serif;font-size:14px; font-weight:normal;overflow:hidden;padding:10px 5px;word-break:normal;} .tg .tg-9z4e{background-color:#FF9F9F;border-color:inherit;font-weight:bold;text-align:center;vertical-align:middle} .tg .tg-c1bx{background-color:#FF9F9F;border-color:inherit;text-align:center;vertical-align:middle}    Station Component Mass Flow $lbm/s$ Temperature $F$ Pressure $psi$ Density $\\frac{lbm}{ft^3}$ Enthalpy $BTU/lbm$     1 Low Pressure Fuel Turbopump Inlet 155 -423 30 4.39 -1912.7   2 Low Pressure Fuel Turbopump Exit 155 -417 298 4.31 -1897   3 High Pressure Fuel Turbopump Inlet 155 -417 250 4.28 -1892.1   4 High Pressure Fuel Turbopump Exit 149 -367 5956 4.92 -1611.7   5 High Pressure Fuel Turbine Coolant 6 -367 5956 4.92 -1608   6 Nozzle Cooling Jacket Inlet 46.6 -367 5624 4.85 -1620.5   7 Nozzle Cooling Jacket Exit 46.6 136 5420 2.00 -612.3   8 Combustion Chamber Liner Inlet 29 -366 5647 4.84 -1617.2   9 Combustion Chamber Liner Exit 29 17 4441 1.57 -352.2   10 Low Pressure Fuel Turbine Inlet 29 17 4217 1.52 -355.5   11 Low Pressure Fuel Turbine Exit 29 0 3169 1.34 -430.6   12 Fuel Preburner Coolant Passages 17 0 3169 1.34 -430.6   13 Fuel Preburner H2 Inlet 77 -193 5310 2.65 -1075.9   14 Oxidizer Preburner H2 Inlet 42 -193 5310 2.65 -1075.9   15 Oxidizer Preburner Coolant Passages 11 0 3169 1.34 -430.6   16 External Hydrogen Tank Ullage Gas Supply 1 0 3169 1.34 -430.6      Next   Top "},{"id":1,"href":"/turbomachinery/4.1-low-pressure-fuel-system/","title":"4.1 Low Pressure Fuel System","parent":"4.  Turbomachinery","content":"  MathJax = { tex: {inlineMath: [['$', '$'], ['\\\\(', '\\\\)']]} };   \nFigure 4.1.1: SSME Fuel System Schematic  [1]\nThe equations of state developed in Section 2 and the combustion model developed in Section 3 provide all the necessary tools to perform a high-level analysis of the SSME\u0026rsquo;s turbomachinery. We begin with the Low Pressure Fuel Turbopump.\nLow Pressure Fuel Turbopump  Liquid hydrogen enters this pump at Station 1 from the external tank with a known pressure, known temperature, and known mass flow rate (set by the overall mixture ratio, see Equation 3.1.1). We assume the desired output pressure from the pump is known, along with the pump\u0026rsquo;s efficiency, $\\eta$. The task is to determine how much power, $\\dot W$, is required to drive the pump under these conditions. Since input pressure and temperature are known, the Helmholtz equation of state can be used to calculate the input density and input enthalpy, $h_1$, with Equation 2.2.3. Input entropy, $s_1$, can be calculated with Equation 2.2.4.\nThere are not many known quantities on the output side of the pump at Station 2. Liquid hydrogen is compressible under certain conditions (see Figure 2.2.1), so it is not always valid to assume that $\\rho_1 = \\rho_2$. This pump is only 71.3 percent efficient, so not all of the input shaft work is converted into pressure. Some of the shaft work is converted into heat that raises output temperature of the fluid. Therefore it is not safe to assume $T_1 = T_2$. Known input and output conditions are shown below on Figure 4.1.2\nFigure 4.1.2 Now the First Law of Thermodynamics can be applied to simplify the above system in a similar manner to that described in Section 3.2. First, we assume that there is no significant increase in fluid kinetic energy or gravitational potential energy between either side of the pump. This means that $V_1=V_2$ and $Z_1 = Z_2$. We assume there is no heat transfer through walls of the pump, but there is shaft work, $\\dot W$, being applied to pressurize the fluid. Conservation of mass requires that $\\rho_1V_1A_1 = \\rho_2V_2A_2$. With these assumptions the First Law of Thermodynamics reduces to:\n(4.1.1) $$ \\dot W = \\dot m\\, \\left(h_2 - h_1\\right) $$ Enthalpy is a state function, so we need a method to solve for one additional state variable ($\\rho_2$ or $T_2$) in order to find $h_2$ using the Helmholtz correlation for hydrogen, Equation 2.1.7. To do this we turn to a definition for pump efficiency, $\\eta_P$:[4] \n(4.1.2) $$ \\eta_P = \\frac{h_{2s}-h_1}{h_{2a}-h_1} $$ It is important to note that in the above equation there are two different output enthalpies, $h_{2s}$ and $h_{2a}$, that must be accounted for. These enthalpies correspond to two different states: the isentropic state $2s$ (a theoretical construct that assumes no entropy generation as fluid travels through the pump), and the actual state $2a$ reached after accounting for effects of entropy. These states are shown on the following h-s diagram:\nFigure 4.1.3: Low Pressure Fuel Turbopump h-s Diagram Figure 4.1.3 shows that $s_{2s} = s_1$. $P_1$ and $P_2$ are also known. Although these two known state variables theoretically should allow us to calculate the remaining thermodynamic properties at Stations 1 and 2, these variables don\u0026rsquo;t line up with Helmholtz equation of state developed in Section 2.2. The Helmholtz model requires two of the following three variables to be known: temperature, pressure, or density. In this case we only know pressure and entropy. There are three steps to resolve this problem.\nStep 1: Establish a multi-variable Newton-Raphson scheme similar to the one described in Section 3.3 and solve for $T_{2s}$, $\\rho_{2s}$, and $h_{2s}$ iteratively using the known values of $P_1$, $P_2$, $s_1$, and $s_{2s}$ as inputs.\nFirst, guess initial values for $T_{2s,i}$ and $\\rho_{2s,i}$ and use these values as the center points in a central finite difference scheme to solve for $\\frac{\\partial{s_{2s}}}{\\partial{T}}$ and $\\frac{\\partial{s_{2s}}}{\\partial{\\rho}}$. The corresponding centered finite differences are shown below.\n(4.1.3) $$ \\frac{\\partial{s_{2s}}}{\\partial{T}} = \\frac{s_2\\left(T_{2s,i}-\\Delta T,\\rho_{2s,i}\\right)+s_2\\left(T_{2s,i}+\\Delta T,\\rho_{2s,i}\\right)} {2\\Delta T} $$  (4.1.4) $$ \\frac{\\partial{s_{2s}}}{\\partial{\\rho}} = \\frac{s_2\\left(T_{2s,i},\\,\\rho_{2s,i}-\\Delta\\rho\\right)+s_2\\left(T_{2s,i},\\, \\rho_{2s,i}+\\Delta\\rho\\right)} {2\\Delta \\rho} $$  The function $s_2\\left(T, \\rho\\right)$ is modeled by Equation 2.2.4.\nNext, establish finite differences for $\\frac{\\partial{P_{2s}}}{\\partial{T}}$ and $\\frac{\\partial{P_{2s}}}{\\partial{\\rho}}$ in a similar manner. The corresponding centered finite differences are shown below.\n(4.1.5) $$ \\frac{\\partial{P_{2s}}}{\\partial{T}} = \\frac{P_2\\left(T_{2s,i}-\\Delta T,\\,\\rho_{2s,i}\\right)+P_2\\left(T_{2s,i}+\\Delta T,\\rho_{2s,i}\\right)} {2\\Delta T} $$  (4.1.6) $$ \\frac{\\partial{P_{2s}}}{\\partial{\\rho}} = \\frac{P_2\\left(T_{2,i},\\,\\rho_{2,i}-\\Delta\\,\\rho\\right)+P_2\\left(T_{2,i},\\,\\rho_{2,i}+\\Delta\\,\\rho\\right)} {2\\Delta \\rho} $$  The function $P_2\\left(T, \\rho\\right)$ is modeled by Equation 2.2.2.\nThe resulting matrix equation becomes:\n(4.1.7) $$\\left[\\begin{matrix} \\frac{\\partial{s_{2s}}}{\\partial{T}} \u0026 \\frac{\\partial{s_{2s}}}{\\partial{\\rho}} \\\\ \\frac{\\partial{P_2}}{\\partial{T}} \u0026 \\frac{\\partial{P_2}}{\\partial{\\rho}} \\end{matrix}\\right] \\\\ \\left[\\begin{matrix} x \\\\ y\\end{matrix}\\right] = \\left[\\begin{matrix} -s_{2s}\\left(T_{2si},\\rho_{2s,i}\\right) +s_{2s}\\left(T_1, \\rho_1\\right) \\\\ -P_{2s}\\left(T_{2s,i},\\rho_{2s,i}\\right) + P_2 \\end{matrix}\\right] $$  where x and y are intermediate values. This system can be solved for $x$ and $y$ using a Gauss elimination routine.[47]  Once $x$ and $y$ are known, updated values for $T_{2s,i+1}$ and $\\rho_{2s,i+1}$ can be determined as follows:\n(4.1.8) $$\\left[\\begin{matrix} T_{2s,i+1} \\\\ \\rho_{2s,i+1} \\end{matrix}\\right]= \\left[\\begin{matrix} x \\\\ y \\end{matrix}\\right] + \\\\ \\left[\\begin{matrix} T_{2s,i} \\\\ \\rho_{2s,i}\\end{matrix}\\right] $$  Te updated temperature and density values are plugged into the Helmholtz model to calculate refined pressure, entropy, and enthalpy values and use these to establish relative error:\n(2.2.2) $$ P_{2,i+1} = P\\left(T_{2s,i+1},\\,\\rho_{2s,i+1} \\right)$$  (2.2.4) $$ s_{2s,i+1} = s\\left(T_{2s,i+1},\\,\\rho_{2s,i+1} \\right)$$  (2.2.3) $$ h_{2s,i+1} = h\\left(T_{2s,i+1},\\,\\rho_{2s,i+1} \\right)$$  (4.1.9) $$ \\text{error}_1 =\\text{abs}\\left(P_{2,i+1}-P_2\\right)$$  (4.1.10) $$ \\text{error}_2 =\\text{abs}\\left(s_{2,i+1}-s_1\\right)$$  The average error is calculated as $\\left(\\text{error}_1 +\\text{error}_2 \\right)/2$.\nThe isentropic enthalpy, $ h_{2s,i+1}$, (modeled by Equation 2.2.3) has converged to a solution when the average error becomes less than a desired tolerance.  Step 2: Solve for $h_{2a}$ and $\\dot W$ We can now plug the isentropic enthalpy value into Equation 4.1.2 and solve for the actual output enthalpy value accounting for effects of entropy:\n$$h_{2a}=\\left(h_{2s,i+1}-h_1\\right)/\\eta_P+h_1$$\nThe amount of power required to drive the turbopump is the determined via Equation 4.1.11:\n(4.1.11) $$ \\dot W = \\dot m\\ \\left(h_{2a}-h_1\\right) $$ Step 3: Solve for $T_{2a}$ We now have four known state variables on the output side of the pump: $h_{2a}$, $\\rho_{2s}$, $s_{2a}$, and $P_2$. Unfortunately, selecting any combination of two of these variables still does not give enough information to yield an explicit solution for $T_{2a}$. Once again we must rely on an iterative method. The procedure is very similar to that described in Step 2.\nFirst, guess initial values for $T_{2a,i}$ and $\\rho_{2a,i}$ and use these values as the center points in a central finite difference scheme to solve for $\\frac{\\partial{h_{2a}}}{\\partial{T}}$ and $\\frac{\\partial{h_{2a}}}{\\partial{\\rho}}$. The corresponding centered finite differences are shown below.\n(4.1.12) $$ \\frac{\\partial{h_{2a}}}{\\partial{T}} = \\frac{h_2\\left(T_{2a,i}-\\Delta T,\\rho_{2a,i}\\right)+h_2\\left(T_{2a,i}+\\Delta T,\\rho_{2a,i}\\right)} {2\\Delta T} $$  (4.1.13) $$ \\frac{\\partial{h_{2a}}}{\\partial{\\rho}} = \\frac{h_2\\left(T_{2a,i},\\,\\rho_{2a,i}-\\Delta\\rho\\right)+s_2\\left(T_{2a,i},\\, \\rho_{2a,i}+\\Delta\\rho\\right)} {2\\Delta \\rho} $$  The function $h_2\\left(T, \\rho\\right)$ is modeled by Equation 2.2.3.\nNext, use the finite differences established for $\\frac{\\partial{P_{2}}}{\\partial{T}}$ and $\\frac{\\partial{P_{2}}}{\\partial{\\rho}}$ (Equations 4.1.5 and 4.1.6) to construct the following system:\n(4.1.14) $$\\left[\\begin{matrix} \\frac{\\partial{h_{2a}}}{\\partial{T}} \u0026 \\frac{\\partial{h_{2a}}}{\\partial{\\rho}} \\\\ \\frac{\\partial{P_2}}{\\partial{T}} \u0026 \\frac{\\partial{P_2}}{\\partial{\\rho}} \\end{matrix}\\right] \\\\ \\left[\\begin{matrix} x \\\\ y\\end{matrix}\\right] = \\left[\\begin{matrix} -h_{2a}\\left(T_{2a,i},\\rho_{2a,i}\\right) +h_{2a} \\\\ -P_{2a}\\left(T_{2a,i},\\rho_{2a,i}\\right) + P_2 \\end{matrix}\\right] $$  where $x$ and $y$ are intermediate values. This system can be solved for $x$ and y$$ using a Gauss elimination routine. Once x and y are known, updated values for $T_{2a,i+1}$ and $\\rho_{2a,i+1}$ can be determined as follows:\n(4.1.15) $$\\left[\\begin{matrix} T_{2a,i+1} \\\\ \\rho_{2a,i+1} \\end{matrix}\\right]= \\left[\\begin{matrix} x \\\\ y \\end{matrix}\\right] + \\\\ \\left[\\begin{matrix} T_{2a,i} \\\\ \\rho_{2a,i}\\end{matrix}\\right] $$  We then plug the updated temperature and density values into the Helmholtz model to calculate refined pressure and enthalpy values, then use these to establish relative error:\n(2.2.2) $$ P_{2,i+1} = P\\left(T_{2a,i+1},\\,\\rho_{2a,i+1} \\right)$$  (2.2.3) $$ h_{2a,i+1} = h\\left(T_{2a,i+1},\\,\\rho_{2a,i+1} \\right)$$  (4.1.16) $$ \\text{error}_1 =\\text{abs}\\left(P_{2,i+1}-P_2\\right)$$  (4.1.17) $$ \\text{error}_2 =\\text{abs}\\left(h_{2a,i+1}-h_{2a}\\right)$$  The average error is calculated as $\\left(\\text{error}_1 +\\text{error}_2 \\right)/2$.\nThe actual output temperature, $ T_{2a,i+1}$, has converged to a solution when the average error becomes less than a desired tolerance.  Results of this calculation are tabulated below. This model predicts the Low Pressure Fuel Turbopump\u0026rsquo;s output power requirement to within 3% of actual values. While these values are not perfect, they are sufficient for preliminary design estimates and validate both the procedure developed in this section and the Helmholtz equation of state developed in Section 2.2 .\n.tg77 {border-collapse:collapse;border-spacing:0; margin-left:22%; margin-right:20%;} .tg td{border-color:black;border-style:solid;border-width:1px;font-family:Arial, sans-serif;font-size:14px; overflow:hidden;padding:10px 5px;word-break:normal;} .tg th{border-color:black;border-style:solid;border-width:1px;font-family:Arial, sans-serif;font-size:14px; font-weight:normal;overflow:hidden;padding:10px 5px;word-break:normal;} .tg .tg-c3ow{border-color:inherit;text-align:center;vertical-align:top} .tg .tg-7btt{border-color:inherit;font-weight:bold;text-align:center;vertical-align:top}     Calculated Actual Value [2]  Relative Error (%)     $T_2$ $[K]$ 22.31 23.7 5.86   $\\dot W$ $[Hp]$ 3421 3330 2.73    Table 4.1.1: Low Pressure Fuel Turbopump Calculation Results Low Pressure Fuel Turbine Now we know how much power is required to operate the Low Pressure Fuel Turbopump. The question then becomes how to generate that power. The Low Pressure Fuel Turbine accomplishes this task. Liquid hydrogen enters the turbine at Station 10, as shown above on Figure 4.1.1 The turbine rotors extract energy from the flow in (in the form of pressure and temperature drop between Stations 10 and 11) and convert it to shaft work which is then used to spin the compressor in the Low Pressure Fuel Turbopump. We assume the flow inlet conditions at Station 10 are known. We also know the maximum allowable pressure drop between Stations 10 and 11 (established by the minimum required inlet pressure into the main combustion chamber). These conditions are shown below on Figure 4.1.4.\nFigure 4.1.4 A key difference between the turbine analysis and pump analysis is that in the case of the turbine we do not know the mass flow rate through the system. We need to solve for the mass flow rate required to generate the 3330 HP demanded by the Low Pressure Fuel Pump. The solution procedure is almost identical to that of used for the Low Pressure Fuel Pump. All of the equations used in Steps 1 and 3 are still valid. In Step 2 a definition for turbine efficiency, $\\eta_T$, is introduced:[4] \n(4.1.18) $$ \\eta_T = \\frac{h_{10}-h_{11a}}{h_{10}-h_{11s}} $$ where again 11a and 11s correspond to the respective actual and isentropic states. These states are plotted below on an h-s diagram:\nFigure 4.1.5 The required mass flow rate through the turbine then becomes:\n\n(4.1.19) $$ \\dot m = \\frac{-\\dot W}{\\left(h_{11a}-h_{10}\\right)} $$ The negative sign on $\\dot W$ accounts for the fact that work is being extracted from the system. Results of this calculation are tabulated below. This model predicts the Low Pressure Fuel Turbine\u0026rsquo;s output temperature and required mass flow requirement to within 10% of actual values. While far from perfect, this is sufficient for \u0026ldquo;back of the envelope\u0026rdquo; preliminary design estimates.\n.tg77 {border-collapse:collapse;border-spacing:0;margin-left:22%; margin-right:20%;} .tg td{border-color:black;border-style:solid;border-width:1px;font-family:Arial, sans-serif;font-size:14px; overflow:hidden;padding:10px 5px;word-break:normal;} .tg th{border-color:black;border-style:solid;border-width:1px;font-family:Arial, sans-serif;font-size:14px; font-weight:normal;overflow:hidden;padding:10px 5px;word-break:normal;} .tg .tg-c3ow{border-color:inherit;text-align:center;vertical-align:top} .tg .tg-7btt{border-color:inherit;font-weight:bold;text-align:center;vertical-align:top}     Calculated Actual Value [2]  Relative Error (%)     $T_{11}$ $[K]$ 249.2 255.4 2.43   $\\dot m_{11}$ $[\\frac{kg}{s}]$ 14.47 13.2 9.62    Table 4.1.2: Low Pressure Fuel Turbine Calculation Results Previous   Next   Top "},{"id":2,"href":"/turbomachinery/4.2-high-pressure-fuel-system/","title":"4.2 High Pressure Fuel System","parent":"4.

The desired pressure on the output side of the pump (Station 4) is known, but all other output state variables are unknown. The input and output mass flow rates are known. In this case the mass flow rate at Station 4 is slightly less than the mass flow rate at Station 3 due to a small quantity of hydrogen that is diverted to cool the High Pressure Fuel Turbine (Station 5).

The high pressure turbine is gas-driven, where the low pressure turbine is is driven by supercritical hydrogen. Prior to analyzing the high pressure fuel turbine, we must first develop a model to predict the thermodynamic properties of the gas entering the turbine blades from the fuel preburner.\nFuel Preburner  The fuel preburner is a combustion chamber that converts liquid hydrogen and oxygen into a gaseous mixture of hydrogen and water vapor that is used to drive the blades of the High Pressure Fuel Turbine. The desired pressure in the preburner is known, along with the temperature, pressure, and mixture ratio of the reactants entering at Stations 13 and 27. The combustion model developed in Section 3 is then utilized to compute temperature and thermodynamic properties of the resulting gaseous mixture. Input and exit conditions are shown below in Figure 4.2.3.\nFigure 4.2.3 Once again, the combustion model delivers excellent results. The flame temperature predicted by the model is within 1% of values measured in the actual SSME.\n \n   Predicted Value Actual Value[2]  Relative Error (%)     $T_{29}$ $[K]$ 986 983 0.3   $H_2$ Mole Fraction 0.892  -  -    $H_2O$ Mole Fraction 0.108  -  -      Table 4.2.2  Mixture Ratio Selection  The preceding analysis neglected to explain how we determined a suitable mixture ratio, $\\dot m_{27}/ \\dot m_{13}$, for input into the Fuel Preburner. The function of the preburner is to convert liquid propellants into gas that will drive the high pressure fuel turbine. Any propellant consumed in the preburner will be unavailable for use in the main combustion chamber. Therefore it makes sense to minimize propellant consumption in the preburners in order to maximize the amount propellant reaching the main combustion chamber. We can tailor Equation 4.1.19 for the High Pressure Fuel Turbine and calculate the required mass flow rate:\n(4.2.1) $$ \\dot m_{29} = \\frac{-\\dot W}{\\left(h_{30}-h_{29}\\right)\\eta_T} $$ The amount of power the turbine must generate, $\\dot W$, is 63,080 Hp. This is the amount of power consumed by the High Pressure Fuel pump, as described above. Turbine efficiency, $\\eta_T$, is 0.811. The only remaining unknown factor is the difference in gas enthalpy between the turbine exit and entrance: $\\left(h_{30}-h_{29}\\right)$. Equation 4.2.1 shows that required mass flow rate is minimized when the quantity $\\left(h_{30}-h_{29}\\right)$ is maximized. We assume the turbine exit enthalpy, $h_{30}$, is an unknown, but fixed value set by the turbine exit temperature. The output enthalpy from the Fuel Preburner, $h_{29}$, can be modeled as a function of mixture ratio by utilizing the procedure developed in Section 3. The resulting trend is plotted below. There is some minor turbulence on these charts due to the solution scheme used in the combustion model. This model utilizes a Gauss elimination to solve a system of linear equations represented in matrix form. Unfortunately the determinant of this matrix tends to approach zero for small mixture ratios. The solution scheme can encounter difficulty solving these near-singular systems. The results remain fairly accurate, but the resulting plots are not too pretty.\nFigure 4.2.4 As a result of the enthalpy reference scale selected, all calculated values of $h_{29}$ are negative (refer to Section 2.5). Therefore in order maximize the value of $\\left(h_{30}-h_{29}\\right)$ we should select a mixture ratio that minimizes the absolute value of $h_{29}$. Figure 4.2.4 shows that this occurs as the mixture ratio approaches 8. But there is one more trend that must be accounted for. As the fuel preburner mixture ratio increases, so does the gas output temperature:\nFigure 4.2.5 If we selected a mixture ratio of 8 the resulting gas would have a temperature over 3800 K. This would make for a very efficient turbine, as long as the blades on the rotor and stator could handle that temperature without melting. Unfortunately there is not currently a suitable material in existence that can withstand both the high temperatures and stresses imposed when the rotor begins to spin at 34,000 rpm. Therefore mixture ratio selection is constrained by the maximum turbine inlet temperature the rotor blades can survive. The turbine inlet temperature ($T_{29}$) predicted by the combustion model in the calculations above was 986 K (713 Celcius). This lines up fairly well with actual SSME turbine inlet temperature data, as shown below in the \u0026ldquo;steady state\u0026rdquo; portion of Figure 4.2.6. This figure models SSME turbine inlet temperature at the SSME\u0026rsquo;s Full Power Level (FPL) of 109%. This website models the SSME at the Nominal Power Level (NPL) of 104%, so the turbine inlet temperatures calculated above are slightly lower than what is plotted in the figure.\nFigure 4.2.6: High Pressure Fuel Turbine Inlet Temperature at FPL[49]\nA great deal of research has been done to develop materials for turbine engines that can withstand these high inlet temperatures. The RS-25 utilizes turbine blades made from a material called MAR-M246[48]. This superalloy is made of approximately 60% nickel, 10% cobalt, 10% tungsten, 9% chromium, and a handful of other elements.[50] It displays good strength characteristics in the range of turbine inlet temperatures expected between the SSME\u0026rsquo;s Minimum Power Level (MPL) and Full Power Level (FPL), as shown below on Figure 4.2.7.\nFigure 4.2.7[51]\nAs mentioned above, if we were to combust hydrogen and oxygen in the Fuel Preburner at a mixture ratio of 8, the resulting turbine inlet temperature would be 3800 K. But as shown by Figure 4.2.7, the ultimate tensile strength of MAR-M2460 goes to zero at approximately 1400 K (1127 C). We must clearly select a lower mixture ratio in order to reduce the turbine inlet temperature. If we could calculate the maximum stress expected in the turbine blade we could select a mixture ratio (and corresponding turbine inlet temperature) that ensures tensile strength limits are not exceeded. The following figure displays the output from a finite element analysis to predict blade stress when the turbine is spinning at full power:\nFigure 4.2.8: Turbine Blade Stresses During Cruise[51]\nAlthough the black and white color scheme from this rather old plot is not very useful, the scale on the right hand side of the figure shows that maximum stress expected in the turbine blades is 894 MPa. We can then utilize Figure 4.2.7 to determine that the ultimate tensile strength of MAR-M246 drops below 894 MPa at a temperature near 713 C (986 K). Then returning to Figure 4.2.5 we can see that mixture ratio cannot exceed 0.871 if the turbine inlet temperature is to remain below the limit imposed by maximum allowable tensile stress. \n Turbine Mass Flow Rate  The preceding calculations enabled us to determine the relative proportions of liquid hydrogen and oxygen required to power the fuel preburner. Although we selected a mixture ratio of 0.871, this number does not tells us anything about overall mass flow rate required to power the system, or the properties of the gas leaving the turbine. Input and output conditions are shown below on Figure 4.2.9. For this analysis we assume the desired output pressure from the turbine is known.\nFigure 4.2.9 To solve for the turbine output temperature, $T_{30}$, we define a function $s^*$ based on the entropy of the gas:[4]\n(4.2.2) $$ s^*\\left(T\\right) = \\int_0^{T} C_p\\left(T\\right)\\,\\frac{dT}{T} $$ We already know the function $C_p\\left(T\\right)$ for both hydrogen and oxygen from Equation 2.4.1. The output from the Fuel Preburner calculation conducted above gives us the mole fraction of each out species $\\left(H_2 = 0.89\\right)$ and $\\left(H_2O=0.11\\right)$. We can use these values to weight Equation 2.4.1 and assemble a combined function for $C_p\\left(T\\right)$:\n(4.2.3) $$ C_{p\\, total}\\left(T\\right) = 0.89\\,C_{p\\, H_2} + 0.11\\,C_{p\\, H_2O} $$ Next, we define a function for the relative pressure, $P_r$, of the gas:\n(4.2.4) $$P_r = \\text{exp}\\left(\\frac{s^*\\left(T\\right)}{R_u}\\right) $$Next, we use these equations to tabulate $P_r$ as a function of $T$ for temperatures from 0 to the turbine inlet temperature, $T_{29}$:\nFigure 4.2.10 The relative pressure at the turbine exit, $Pr_{30}$ is calculated as follows:\n(4.2.5) $$P_{r\\,30} = \\frac{P_{30}}{P_{29}}\\,P_{r\\,29} $$This relation enables us to use Figure 4.2.10 as a look-up table. We enter the table at the known turbine inlet temperature,$T_{29}$, and read the associated reduced pressure, $P_{r29}$. We then plug this reduced pressure into Equation 4.2.5 and solve for $P_{r30}$. We read up the table from $ P_{r29}$ until we find the value of $P_{r30}$. From here, we can read the associated turbine outlet temperature, $T_{30}$. This temperature is then plugged in to both Equation 2.4.2 (after weighting to account for $H_2$ and $H_2O$ mole fractions) and the ideal gas law to solve for properties at the turbine exit. Results of this calculation are shown below.\nFigure 4.2.11 We now have all of the data needed to use Equation 4.2.1 and solve for $\\dot m_{29}$, the mass flow rate through the turbine. Performing this calculation reveals that $\\dot m_{29}$ is 68.2 kg/sec. Figure 4.2.1 shows that $\\dot m_{29}$ must be equal to the sum of $\\dot m_{27}$ and $\\dot m_{13}$. From the mixture ratio analysis described above we also know that $\\frac{\\dot m_{27}}{\\dot m_{13}}=0.871$. We can use these two relations to solve for the individual values of $\\dot m_{27}$ and $\\dot m_{13}$, which come out to 31.7 and 36.5 kg/sec, respectively.\nOverall results of the high pressure fuel system analysis are tabulated below.

Liquid oxygen from the external tank enters the pump at Station 17 with a known temperature, pressure, and mass flow rate. The desired pressure at the pump exit is known, along with the pump efficiency. The task is to determine the amount of power required to drive the pump and the thermodynamic properties of the liquid oxygen at the pump\u0026rsquo;s exit.\nThere is one key difference between this pump and the Low Pressure Fuel Pump. The output from the from the Low Pressure Oxidizer Turbopump is mixed with the output from the Low Pressure Oxidizer Turbine. Both of these flows combine at Station 18. The Low Pressure Fuel Turbopump uses separate lines for the flow traveling through the pump (Stations 1 and 2) and the turbine (Stations 10 and 11). In this analysis, Station 23 represents the Low Pressure Oxidizer Turbine exit, prior to mixing at Station 18. Station 18p will be used to represent the Low Pressure Oxidizer turbopump exit prior to mixing at Station 18. The calculations are performed with an analogous procedure to that described in Section 4.1 to solve for the output conditions at Station 18p. Results are shown below.\nFigure 4.3.2 We can then use Equation 4.3.1 to solve for the power required to run the pump:\n(4.3.1) $$ \\dot W = \\dot m_{17}\\left(h_{18p}-h_{17}\\right) $$ The results of the calculation are tabulated below.

We assume the flow inlet conditions at Station 22 are known. We also know the maximum allowable pressure drop between Stations 22 and 23 (flow leaving the turbine merges with the output flow from low pressure pump). Output conditions are solved for using a similar procedure to that described for the Low Pressure Fuel Turbine in Section 4.1. Input and output conditions are shown below on Figure 4.3.3.

Combustion gas exits the Oxidizer Preburner at Station 31 and spins the blades of the High Pressure Oxidizer turbine. The shaft on this turbine drives two pumps: the High-Pressure Oxidizer Boost Pump and the Preburner Oxidizer Boost Pump. We will begin the analysis by determining the power requirement of these two pumps. Next, we will calculate the output enthalpy from the Oxidizer Preburner.

The desired pressure in the preburner is known, along with the temperature, pressure, and mixture ratio of the reactants entering at Stations 14 and 26.

Input and exit conditions are shown below.\nFigure 4.4.4:\nThe mixture ratio selected for this combustion chamber, $\\dot m_{26} / \\dot m_{14}$, was selected based on the maximum allowable turbine inlet temperature at Station 31.

As in described in Section 4.2, we work backward from this temperature to determine the corresponding mixture ratio and output enthalpy from the preburner. Plots to accomplish this task are shown below. There is some minor turbulence on these charts due to the solution scheme used in the combustion model. This model utilizes Gauss elimination to solve a system of linear equations represented in matrix form. Unfortunately the determinant of this matrix tends to approach zero for small mixture ratios.

Mole fractions of the gas entering the turbine are known based on the results of the combustion calculation described above (0.926 for hydrogen and 0.074 for water).

Before reading on, it might be a good idea to review Section 3.1 for a more thorough description of how these calculations are performed. We begin by adapting the four primary chemical reactions to account for the addition of $z$ moles per second of $H_2O$:\n(3.1.a) $$x\\,H_{2} + y\\,O_{2}+z\\,H_2O \\rightleftharpoons \\left(2\\,y+z\\right)H_{2}O +\\left(x-2y\\right)H_2 $$ (3.1.b) $$H_{2} \\rightleftharpoons 2\\,H $$ (3.1.c) $$O_{2} \\rightleftharpoons 2\\,O $$ (3.1.d) $$ 2\\,H_{2}O \\rightleftharpoons H_2 +2\\,OH $$ The $\\sum\\Delta_C$ values for Equations 3.1a-d remain unchanged, as the additional $z$ term on both the left and right sides of Equation 3.1a cancel out:\n.tg12 {border-collapse:collapse;border-spacing:0;margin-left:26%; margin-right:20%;} .tg12 td{border-color:black;border-style:solid;border-width:1px;font-family:Arial, sans-serif;font-size:14px; overflow:hidden;padding:10px 5px;word-break:normal;} .tg12 th{border-color:black;border-style:solid;border-width:1px;font-family:Arial, sans-serif;font-size:14px; font-weight:normal;overflow:hidden;padding:10px 5px;word-break:normal;} .tg12 .tg-c3ow{border-color:inherit;text-align:center;vertical-align:top} .tg12 .tg-7btt{border-color:inherit;font-weight:bold;text-align:center;vertical-align:top}    Equation $ H_2$ $ O_2$ $ H_2O$ $ OH$ $ O$ $ H$     3.1.a -2ya -ya 2ya 0 0 0   3.1.b -b 0 0 0 0 2b   3.1.c 0 -c 0 0 2c 0   3.1.d d 0 -2d 2d 0 0   $\\sum\\Delta_C$ -2ya-b+d -ya-c 2ya-2d 2d 2c 2b    Table 4.5.3 However, the overall chemical reaction does change. A $z$ term is added in the coefficient for $H_2O$:\n(3.1.5) $$x\\,H_{2} + y\\,O_{2}+z\\,H_2O \\implies \\left(2\\,y\\,a-2\\,d +z\\right)H_{2}O +\\left(x-2y\\,a-b+d\\right)H_2 + \\left(y-y\\,a-c\\right)O_2+2\\,d\\,OH+2\\,b\\,H+2\\,c\\,O $$ Adding additional $H_2O$ as a product of the reaction changes the equilibrium mass fraction of each species, as shown by the following modifications to Equations 3.1.6 - 3.1.12:\n(3.1.6) $$N_{prod} =\\sum\\,C_i =-ya+x+y+z+b+c+d $$ (3.1.7) $$Z_{O_2} =\\frac{y-ya-c}{N_{prod}} $$ (3.1.8) $$Z_{H_2O} =\\frac{2ya-2d+z}{N_{prod}} $$ (3.1.9) $$Z_{H_2} =\\frac{x-2ya-b+d}{N_{prod}} $$ (3.1.10) $$Z_{OH} =\\frac{2d}{N_{prod}} $$ (3.1.11) $$Z_{H} =\\frac{2b}{N_{prod}} $$ (3.1.12) $$Z_{O} =\\frac{2c}{N_{prod}} $$ Finally, we must update the representation of the First Law of thermodynamics described by Equation 3.2.13 to account for addition of excess $H_2O$ as a reactant:\n(3.2.13) $$ 0 = \\dot{N}_{H_2}\\left[h_{H_2}\\left(T,P\\right)\\right] + \\dot{N}_{O_2}\\left[h_{O_2}\\left(T,P\\right)\\right]+ \\dot{N}_{H2_O}\\left[h_{O_2}\\left(T\\right)\\right] - \\sum_{i=1}^6 h_{2,i}\\,\\dot{N} _i $$ We then utilize the correlations developed in Sections 2.2, 2.3, and 2.4 to calculate the enthalpy of the reactants as they enter the combustion chamber at the pressures and temperatures listed above in Tables 4.5.1 and 4.5.2. These enthalpy values are then plugged in to the updated model of the First Law, Equation 3.2.13. It should be noted that the hydrogen at Stations 12 and 15 and the oxygen at Station 21 must be treated as \u0026ldquo;real\u0026rdquo; fluids. The Helmholtz correlation from Sections 2.2 and 2.3 must be utilized to calculate properties. The hydrogen and water departing the preburners at Stations 30 and 32 is much hotter and can be treated as an ideal gas, so the property curve fits from Section 2.4 are used.\nPressure inside the LTMCC is designed to be 2871 psia when the engine is operating at 104.5% of its rated power level.[2] We now have enough input data to run the combustion model one final time! Results of this the calculation are tabulated below. They are in excellent agreement with actual data from the SSME. Flame temperature and specific impulse are accurate to within 1%.\n\nProperties  .tg {border-collapse:collapse;border-spacing:0;margin:0px auto;} .tg td{border-color:black;border-style:solid;border-width:1px;font-family:Arial, sans-serif;font-size:14px; overflow:hidden;padding:10px 5px;word-break:normal;} .tg th{border-color:black;border-style:solid;border-width:1px;font-family:Arial, sans-serif;font-size:14px; font-weight:normal;overflow:hidden;padding:10px 5px;word-break:normal;} .tg .tg-zqao{background-color:#FDFB93;border-color:#000000;font-weight:bold;text-align:center;vertical-align:middle} .tg .tg-44kd{background-color:#FDFB93;border-color:#000000;text-align:left;vertical-align:middle} .tg .tg-6dvz{background-color:#FDFB93;border-color:#000000;text-align:center;vertical-align:middle}    Property Predicted Actual[2]  Percent Error     Flame Temperature $[K]$ 3560 3588 0.59%   Pressure* $[MPa]$ - 18.61 -   Density $[kg/m^3]$ 8.520 - -   Mass Flow Rate $[kg/sec]$ - 492.1 -   Viscosity $[Pa \\cdot s]$ 1.083 x 10-4  - -   Thermal Conductivity $[\\frac{W}{m K]}$ 0.5830 - -   Enthalpy $[kJ/kg]$ -1402.9 - -   Isobaric Heat Capacity $[\\frac{kJ}{kg K}]$ 3.7848 - -   Specific Heat Ratio 1.19346 - -   Specific Gas Constant 613.525 - -   Prandtl Number 0.7031 - -   Speed of Sound $[m/s]$ 1614.6 - -   Specific Impulse ($\\epsilon$ = 69) $[sec]$ 450.36 452 0.36%    *Note: The \"throat stagnation presssure\" reported in this table (18.61 MPa = 2700 psia), differs from the the values reported reported in reference [2]: (19.79 MPa = 2871 psia).

Flow Model","content":"  MathJax = { tex: {inlineMath: [['$', '$'], ['\\\\(', '\\\\)']]} };  Figure 5.1.1: Large Throat Main Combustion Chamber (LTMCC) [52]  The first step in modelling the flow through the LTMCC is to define the geometry of the chamber. We assume a cylindrical design will be used with a converging-diverging throat, as shown above in Figure 5.1.1. The analysis begins by determining the cross-sectional area of the throat (Station 33.1).\n Step 1: Find the Cross Sectional Area of the Throat The pressure, mixture ratio, and enthalpies of the propellants entering the chamber at Station 33 are known from the analysis conducted in Section 4.5. This provides all of the thermodynamic properties of the resulting combustion gas (see Table 4.5.4 ). Interestingly enough, all of the following calculations are dominated by only two properties predicted by the combustion model: specific heat ratio, $\\gamma$, and specific gas constant, $R_s$.\nAt the throat (Station 33.1) conservation of mass dictates that the the Mach number, $ M_{33.1} $, has to be exactly one. This allows us to use Equation 5.1.1 in an implicit Newton-Raphson scheme[53] to solve for nozzle exit Mach number, $M_{34}$, as a function of area ratio, $\\epsilon = \\frac{A_{34}}{A_{33.1}}$. This equation and the resulting plot are shown below. It should be noted that the following equations are standard isentropic relations for variable area flow[28]. These equations do not account for entropy inducing effects such as heat transfer through the nozzle walls or friction due to viscosity. Nevertheless, they still provide accurate results. We will return to this concept and update the model to account for the effects of entropy in Section 5.3.\n(5.1.1) $$ 0= \\frac{M_{33.1}}{M_{34}}\\left(\\frac{1+\\left[\\left(\\gamma-1\\right)/2\\right]\\,M_{34}^2}{1+\\left[\\left(\\gamma-1\\right)/2\\right]\\,M_{33.1}^2}\\right)^\\frac{\\gamma+1}{2\\,\\left(\\gamma-1\\right)} - \\epsilon $$ Figure 5.1.2   Now that $M_{34}$ is known as a function of area ratio, Equation 5.1.2 can be used to solve for the pressure at the nozzle exit plane, $P_{34}$. We then have all data needed to plot $P_{34}$ as a function of area ratio. It is interesting to note that the exit plane pressure approaches zero as area ratio increases. With an infinitely large nozzle, the flow would expand to an ideal vacuum exit pressure of 0. We can never quite get there with a finite area ratio.\n\nIt is important to make one distinction prior to moving on in this section. The value of $P_{33}$ is the stagnation pressure inside the combustion chamber. In Reference [2], Boeing reports this value as 2871 psia (see Table 1.3.1). In reality, it is difficult to measure the stagnation pressure inside the combustion chamber where instrumentation has a tough time surviving the associated high temperatures and pressures. The stagnation pressure reported in Table 1.3.1 is therefore mathematically derived from the measured static temperatures and pressure at the injector face. This conversion must take in to account the effect chemical reactions that occur in the chamber as the flow moves from the injector face through the throat. After the stagnation pressure is predicted, it must be verified by evaluating the actual performance of the engine during a hot-fire test[38]. The analysis used on this website does not account for equilibrium chemical reactions occurring beyond the initial injection/combustion (frozen flow analysis). Therefore the associated mole fractions, molecular weight, and specific heat ratio of the resulting mixture predicted by the model on this website differ slightly from the true values encountered during actual tests of the RS-25.\nNeglecting to account for this difference means that the nozzle stagnation pressure used on this website will differ from the stagnation pressure reported by Boeing. If Boeing\u0026rsquo;s value of 2871 psia is selected as the value for $P_{33}$ in the following calculations, the model will overpredict the engine\u0026rsquo;s mass flow rate and thrust by approximately 5.9%. In order to correct this error, $P_{33}$ has been reduced to approximately 2700 psia for all of the following calculations. This is a reasonable adjustment to make. Reference [38] reports that the pressure drop across the injector face of a combustion chamber is typically on the order of 20 percent. Using the adjusted stagnation pressure 2700 of psi, along with an injector face Mach number of 0.22602 gives a static pressure at the chamber side of the injector face of 2619 psia. This is corresponds to a 15% drop in static pressure from the reported values on the inflow side of the injector face (see Table 1.3.1, Stations 30 and 32).\nAlternatively, instead of reducing the nozzle stagnation pressure, one could adjust the cross-sectional area of the nozzle\u0026rsquo;s throat until the engine\u0026rsquo;s mass flow rate and thrust align with the correct values. Reference [86] contains an excellent discussion that utilizes this procedure. For this website, the nozzle geometry will be maintained and we will proceed by decreasing the throat stagnation pressure ($P_{33}$) to 2700 psia.\n(5.1.2) $$ P_{34} = P_{33} \\left({1+\\frac{(\\gamma-1)}{2}\\,M_{34}^2}\\right)^\\frac{-\\gamma}{\\gamma-1} $$ Figure 5.1.3  Knowing the exit pressure allows us to calculate the nozzle\u0026rsquo;s vacuum thrust coefficient, $C_f$, as a function of area ratio using the familiar equation from Section 3.4:\n(3.4.2) $$ C_f= \\sqrt{\\frac{2\\gamma^2}{\\gamma-1}\\left[\\frac{2}{\\gamma+1}\\right]^{\\frac{\\gamma+1}{\\gamma-1}}\\left[1-\\left(\\frac{P_{34}}{P_{33}}\\right)^{\\frac{\\gamma-1}{\\gamma}}\\right]}+\\epsilon\\left[\\frac{P_{34}}{P_{33}}\\right] $$ Figure 5.1.4  We are now finally equipped to solve for the throat area, $A_{33.1}$, as a function of area ratio. In the following equation, $F$ represents the desired thrust produced by the nozzle at vacuum conditions, 491,000 pounds (see Table 1.3.1)\n(5.1.3) $$ A_{33.1} = \\frac{F}{C_f P_{33}} $$ Figure 5.1.5  Once area ratio and throat area are known, we can multiply them together and solve for exit area, $A_{34}$:\nFigure 5.1.6  The last remaining step is to select an appropriate area ratio and read the corresponding throat and exit areas from Figures 5.1.5 and 5.1.6. This presents a challenge. All of the area ratios plotted above are theoretically possible. How do we select the optimal area ratio? This can be answered by examining the engine\u0026rsquo;s propellant consumption rate as a function of area ratio. First, we must calculate the static temperature and pressure in the nozzle throat, $T_{33.1}$ and $P_{33.1}$ respectively using the known stagnation values of $T_{33}$ and $P_{33}$. This is done with the following equations. Reminder: at the throat (Station 33.1) M=1.0.\n(5.1.4) $$ T_{33.1} = T_{33} \\left({1+\\frac{(\\gamma-1)}{2}\\,M_{33.1}^2}\\right)^{-1} $$ (5.1.5) $$ P_{33.1} = P_{33} \\left({1+\\frac{(\\gamma-1)}{2}\\,M_{33.1}^2}\\right)^\\frac{-\\gamma}{\\gamma-1} $$ Now that temperature and pressure at the nozzle throat are known, we can use the ideal gas law (Equation 2.1.2) and solve for density at the throat, $\\rho_{33.1}$\n(2.1.2) $$ \\rho_{33.1}=\\frac{P_{33.1}}{R_s\\,T_{33.1}} $$ Sonic velocity at the throat is modeled by Equation 5.1.5:\n(5.1.5) $$ V_{33.1} = \\sqrt{\\gamma\\,R_s\\,T_{33.1}} $$ We can combine these equations and finally an reach expression for the required mass flow rate, $\\dot m$:\n(5.1.6) $$ \\dot m = \\rho_{33.1}\\,V_{33.1}\\,A_{33.1} $$ Figure 5.1.7  Figure 5.1.7 shows that the desired 491,000 pounds of thrust can be achieved with many different area ratios. As area ratio increases the required amount of propellant decreases. Therefore to maximize fuel efficiency we should select a very large area ratio. But this does not quiet tell the entire story. As area ratio increases, Figure 5.1.7 shows that the propellant flow rate approaches an asymptotic value. In contrast, Figure 5.1.6 shows that exit area continues to increase linearly with area ratio. This establishes a regime of diminishing returns. Increasing area ratio much higher than 60 will indeed give a slight increase in fuel efficiency for the desired thrust (i.e. specific impulse), but it comes at the expense of a much larger (and heavier nozzle). At some point the gain in fuel efficiency is overwhelmed by the structural mass of the enormous nozzle. For now, we will rely on the analysis provided by Aerojet Rocketdyne and assume the optimal area ratio is 69.5. The corresponding throat area, exit plane area, and propellant mass flow rate are read from Figures 5.1.5 - 5.1.7 and tabulated below. The model developed here matches Rocketdyne\u0026rsquo;s geometry data to within 5%, which is a reasonable preliminary estimate. The propellant flow rate is accurate to within 1%.\n\n   Predicted Value Actual Value[2] Relative Error (%)     $A_{33.1}$ $[m^2]$ 0.05712 0.06002 4.83%   $A_{34}$ $[m^2]$ 3.969  4.132  3.94%    $\\dot m$ $[kg/sec]$ 493.2  492.1  0.22%      Table 5.1.1   Step 2: Determine Chamber Volume In Step 1 we assumed the combustion chamber would be modeled as a cylinder. We need to determine the length of this cylinder, $L_c$, and its cross-sectional area at the injector face, $A_{33}$, in order to find its volume, $V$. According to the American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics (AIAA), the procedure do do this can be \u0026ldquo;rather arbitrary\u0026rdquo;[38]. The chamber must be sufficiently large to give the propellants time to mix and combust before accelerating through the throat. But if the chamber is too large, there will be excessive structural mass penalties, larger cooling requirements, and higher frictional losses in the flow. Empirical data from previous design experience is leveraged to select proper dimensions. The following correlation is suggested for determining injector area:[54]\n(5.1.4) $$ A_{33} = \\left(8\\,D_{33.1}^{-0.6}+1.25\\right)\\,A_{34} $$ where $D_{33.1}$ is the diameter of the throat in cm. Plugging our estimate for $D_{33.1}$ into this equation gives an estimated value of $A_{33}$ of approximately 0.1347 $m^2$ which corresponds to a diameter of 0.414 m. This differs from the true diameter (0.454 m)[52] by only 8.8%. Not too bad for a \u0026ldquo;rather arbitrary\u0026rdquo; empirical correlation!\nNow we turn our attention to estimating the length, $L_c$, of the combustion chamber. $L_c$ is the distance between the injector face (Station 33) and the throat (Station 33.1). To accomplish this we define a \u0026ldquo;characteristic length\u0026rdquo; $L^*$ as follows:\n(5.1.5) $$ L^*=\\frac{V_c}{A_{33.1}} $$ $V_c$ is the volume of the cylindrical combustion chamber, and $A_{33.1}$ is the throat area. $L^*$ must be suffiently large to allow the propellants time to mix and burn before they are ejected from the combustion chamber. Selecting an appropriate length to create the necessary \u0026ldquo;stay time\u0026rdquo; in the chamber requires a complex thermochemical analysis. It is much easier to rely on previous design experience for an initial estimate. The AIAA recommends the following values of $L^*$:[55]\nFigure 5.1.8  After selecting an appropriate value of $L^{*}$ from this table, we can use Equation 5.1.5 to solve for the chamber volume, $V_c$. The actual actual length of the combustion chamber, $L_c$, is then determined with following equation:\n(5.1.6) $$ L_c=\\frac{V_c}{A_{33}} $$ Using these equations we can plot $L_c$ as a function of $L^*$ over the range of values suggested in Figure 5.1.8. The actual value of $L_c$ on the SSME is 15.222 inches [52] and has a corresponding $L^ *$ of 36 inches. This lines up well with the data suggested above.\nFigure 5.1.9  Let\u0026rsquo;s take a moment to review our progress. We utilized properties of the combustion gas generated in the LTMCC to predict the SSME\u0026rsquo;s required mass flow rate, nozzle exit area, throat area, injector area, and combustion chamber length. This geometry is summarized in the pictures below, using actual data from the RS-25. Note that this analysis of the RS-25 Block IIa uses the \u0026ldquo;Large Throat\u0026rdquo; data. The reason the SSME\u0026rsquo;s combustion chamber is at times called the \u0026ldquo;Large Throat\u0026rdquo; Main Combustion Chamber, rather than just the \u0026ldquo;Main Combustion Chamber\u0026rdquo; is because there are actually two different chamber configurations that have been used throughout the SSME lifecycle. The RS-24 through the RS-25B used the \u0026ldquo;Main Combustion Chamber.\u0026rdquo; The RS-25C Block II-A and beyond use the \u0026ldquo;Large Throat Main Combustion Chamber.\u0026quot;[44] As the name implies, the throat geometry differs between these two configurations. Expanding the throat diameter allowed the large throat configuration to produce the same amount of thrust while simultaneously reducing high chamber pressures and temperatures[56].\n\nFigure 5.1.10 [52]  Figure 5.1.11 [57]  Step 3: Generate Wall Coordinates Up to this point, we have been solving for linear dimensions of the combustion chamber such as the diameters of the injector face and throat, and the length of the chamber, $L_c$. But the pictures above show that the chamber walls are curved. We have not yet accounted for this geometry. Fortunately the exact design of the curves inside the combustion chamber do not require any kind of \u0026ldquo;optimum\u0026rdquo; shape analysis. Prior to reaching the throat, the flow is relatively low speed (subsonic). A gently arcing wall with a radius of curvature of similar magnitude to the throat radius is usually sufficient to prevent excessive losses. Using the geometry data in Figures 5.1.10 and 5.1.11 we can derive a set of piecewise equations to represent these arcs as a function of axial position through the LTMCC. The coordinate system originates with $x=0$ inches at the injector face and $r=0$ inches at the LTMCC centerline. The resulting equations and chamber contour are shown below.\n\n\n  x (in) r (in)     $ 0 $ r_{33}$    $ L_e $ \\sqrt{r_1^2-(x-L_e)^2}+r_{33}-r_1 $   $ L_e+r_1\\text{sin}\\left(\\theta_1\\right) $ \\frac{r_t+r_u-r_{33}+r_1-\\left(r_u+r_1\\right)\\text{cos}\\left(\\theta_1\\right)}{L_c-L_e-\\left(r_u+r_1\\right)\\text{sin}\\left(\\theta_1\\right)}\\,x+r_{33}-r_1+r_1\\text{cos}\\left(\\theta_1\\right)-\\frac{r_t+r_u-r_{33}+r_1-\\left(r_u+r_1\\right)\\text{cos}\\left(\\theta_1\\right)}{L_c-L_e-\\left(r_u+r_1\\right)\\text{sin}\\left(\\theta_1\\right)}\\left(L_e+r_1\\text{sin}\\left(\\theta_1\\right)\\right) $    $ L_c-r_u\\text{sin}\\left(\\theta_1\\right) $ -\\sqrt{r_u^2-(x-L_c)^2}+r_t+r_u $    $ L_c $ -\\sqrt{r_D^2-(x-L_c)^2}+r_t+r_D $     Table 5.1.2  \nFigure 5.1.12  Note that the wall coordinates plotted in Figure 5.1.12 stop at $x=16.1$ inches. The actual LTMCC is 24.29 inches long (see Figure 5.1.10). We stopped plotting wall coordinates at $x=16.1$ inches because this is the location where the nozzle contour and the LTMCC contour become identical (take a look at location \u0026ldquo;D\u0026rdquo; in Figure 5.1.10). The LTMCC extends out to $x=24.29$ inches before interfacing with the nozzle attach flange, but the wall contour for both of these devices can be described by the same equation from $x = 16.1$ inches onward. The single equation modeling the final 8 inches of the LTMCC and the entire length of the nozzle is presented in the following section.\nPrevious   Next   Top "},{"id":7,"href":"/flow-model/5.2-nozzle-geometry/","title":"5.2 Nozzle Geometry","parent":"5.  Flow Model","content":"  MathJax = { tex: {inlineMath: [['$', '$'], ['\\\\(', '\\\\)']]} };  In the previous section we defined the geometry of the LTMCC, at times using some \u0026ldquo;rather arbitrary\u0026rdquo; rules of thumb. This was acceptable because the subsonic portion of the LTMCC is relatively tolerant to gradual changes in geometry. This is not the case in the supersonic portion of the LTMCC and nozzle downstream of the throat. In this region we must turn to a more rigorous approach to minimize separation and turbulent losses. [38]\nOne such approach is to use a conical design, as shown below in Figure 5.2.1. Conical nozzles expand linearly from the the throat with a half-angle $\\alpha$ generally ranging between 12-18 degrees. While these nozzles are relatively easy to manufacture, they have several downsides. At the nozzle exit plane a component of flow velocity is not aligned with the vehicle\u0026rsquo;s thrust vector. This component is skewed by an angle of $\\alpha$, which decreases the overall efficiency of engine. This efficiency, $\\lambda$, is plotted below. A typical 15-degree conical nozzle has an efficiency of about 98%. [38]\nFigure 5.2.1 [58]\nThe length of the nozzle from the throat to the exit plane must be considered as well. Prescribing the expansion ratio $\\epsilon$ and and half-angle $\\alpha$ gives the following expression for nozzle length:[38]\n(5.2.1) $$ L= \\frac{R_t\\left(\\sqrt{\\epsilon}-1\\right)+R_u\\,\\text{sec}\\left(\\alpha-1\\right)}{\\text{tan}\\left(\\alpha\\right)} $$. The radii $R_u$ and $R_t$ are defined as shown below in Figure 5.2.2. Typical values of $R_u$ are on the order of 0.5-1.5 times $R_t$.[38] In the case of the SSME, $R_u=0.494R_t$ (see Figure 5.1.1).\nFigure 5.2.2 [58]\nAn engineer by the name of G.V.R. Rao came up with a design to improve upon the conical nozzle.[59], [60] The resulting wall contour is based on a \u0026ldquo;skewed parabola.\u0026rdquo; The length of a Rao nozzle is typically defined to be 80% of the length of a 15-degree conical nozzle with the same expansion ratio. This results in a shorter and lighter nozzle. The parabolic contour reduces the flow exit angle, $\\alpha$ as compared to a conical nozzle. This helps to align the flow exit velocity with the vehicle\u0026rsquo;s thrust vector and increases nozzle efficiency. Figure 5.2.3 highlights the differences between these two designs.\nFigure 5.2.3 [58] The wall coordinates of the Rao curve used on the SSME nozzle can be represented by the following equations. Reference [61] contains an excellent discussion on how these equations are derived. The coordinate system used for the nozzle wall contour is consistent with that established for the wall coordinates of the LTMCC in Section 5.1. In both cases $x$ is defined to be 0 inches at the injector face. In the case of the LTMCC, the piecewise equation for wall coordinates stopped at 16.1 inches (see Table 5.1.2 and Figure 5.1.12 ). The following equation is valid for $x$ values greater than 16.1 inches all the way up to the nozzle exit plane at $x=$ 135.5 inches. The x-coordinate of the nozzle exit plane was calulated by determining the length of an equivalent 80% conical nozzle with Equations 5.2.1 and 5.2.6 (120.25 inches), then adding the length of the LTMCC between the throat and injector face (15.2 inches, see Figure 5.1.10).\nIt is important to remember that although the wall coordinate equations transition at $x=$16.1 inches, this is not the location where the nozzle mates with the LTMCC. The nozzle attach flange is physically located at $x=$24.29 inches. 16.1 inches is the location where the wall contour of the LTMCC and nozzle become identical and can be described by a single equation for both pieces of hardware. Point \u0026ldquo;D\u0026rdquo; in Figure 5.1.10 illustrates this concept.\n\n(5.2.2) $$ r\\left(t\\right) = \\left(1-t\\right)^2N_y+2\\left(t-t^2\\right)Q_y+t^2R_e$$ (5.2.3) $$ t(x)=\\frac{-2Q_x+\\sqrt{4Q_x^2-4(N_x-x+15.444)(-N_x-2Q_x+E_x)}} {2(-N_x-2Q_x+E_x)} $$ (5.2.4) $$ N_x = R_d\\,\\text{cos}\\left( \\theta_d -\\pi/2\\right) $$ (5.2.5) $$ N_y = R_d\\,\\text{sin}\\left( \\theta_d -\\pi/2\\right)+R_d+R_t $$ (5.2.6) $$ E_x= 0.8\\,\\frac{R_t\\left(\\sqrt{\\epsilon}-1\\right)+R_u\\,\\text{sec}\\left(\\alpha-1\\right)}{\\text{tan}\\left(\\alpha\\right)} $$ (5.2.7) $$ Q_x = \\frac{E_y-\\text{tan}\\left(\\alpha\\right)E_x-N_y+\\text{tan}\\left(\\theta_d\\right)N_x}{\\text{tan}\\left(\\theta_d\\right)-\\text{tan}\\left(\\alpha\\right)}$$ (5.2.8) $$ Q_y = \\frac{\\text{tan}\\left(\\theta_d\\right)\\left(R_e-\\text{tan}\\left(\\alpha\\right)E_x\\right)-\\text{tan}\\left(\\alpha\\right)\\left(N_y-\\text{tan}\\left(\\theta_d\\right)N_x\\right)}{\\text{tan}\\left(\\theta_d\\right)-\\text{tan}\\left(\\alpha\\right)}$$ In order to use these equations we must begin with several known radii: $R_t$, $R_d$, $R_e$,and $R_u$ . All of these values are tabulated in Figure 5.1.10 We also must know the wall angle immediately departing the throat ($\\theta_d$) and the nozzle exit angle $\\alpha$. Both of these angles are tabulated in Figure 5.1.11 as well. If these angles are not known a priori, they can be estimated from the following chart as a function of nozzle length and expansion ratio. In the case of the SSME, read the angles associated with the 80% conical nozzle and an expansion ratio of 69.5. The data shown below in Figure 5.2.4 lines up fairly well with the actual SSME data tabulated in Figure 5.1.11.\nFigure 5.2.4 [58] We are now finally positioned to plot the SSME wall contour all the way from the injector face to the nozzle exit plane at $x=135.5$ inches. The colors displayed below correspond to physical hardware in the SSME. Blue represents the walls of the LTMCC and orange represents the nozzle. These components are mated at the nozzle attach flange ($x=$25.19 inches). Both pieces of hardware utilize the same wall contour equation from $x=16.1$ inches onward.\n\nFigure 5.2.5  Previous   Next   Top "},{"id":8,"href":"/flow-model/5.3-compressible-flow/","title":"5.3 Compressible Flow","parent":"5.  Flow Model","content":"  MathJax = { tex: {inlineMath: [['$', '$'], ['\\\\(', '\\\\)']]} };  Sections 5.1 and 5.2 define the geometry of the SSME combustion chamber and nozzle. The analysis in Section 4.5  provides the temperature, pressure, and composition of the gas inside the chamber. Now we will use this information to predict what happens to the combustion products as they depart the LTMCC and accelerate toward the nozzle exit plane. At the conclusion of this section we will have a model that predicts flow properties as a function axial position through the length of the nozzle, taking in to account the effects of heat transfer and friction. This information will be used to verify the estimate of specific impulse from Section 3.4  and set the conditions for an analysis of the regenerative cooling circuit in Section 6 .\nWe could begin by using the isentropic relations from any standard compressible flow textbook and develop expressions for how flow properties vary as a function of cross-sectional area. In fact, that is exactly how we determined the dimensions of the nozzle throat and exit in Section 5.1. Unfortunately this approach neglects to account for the effects of friction or heat transfer. We could obtain a solution that accounts for friction by using a Fanno flow analysis. A basic assumption of Fanno flow is that the cross-sectional area of the duct in question remains constant. That is clearly not true in the case in the SSME nozzle. A Rayleigh flow analysis could help account for heat transfer, but this model is also based on the assumption of constant cross-sectional area. To complicate matters further, both the Rayleigh and Fanno solutions are independent of each other. Fanno flow assumes there is no heat transfer, and Rayleigh flow assumes no friction. [28]\nTo simultaneously account for each of these effects we can establish a \u0026ldquo;quasi one-dimensional\u0026rdquo; model of steady flow through a variable area duct. Flow properties are assumed to be constant across each cross-section of the duct. Only velocities normal to the duct cross section are considered (i.e. there are no velocity gradients perpendicular to the flow axis). Heat transfer is assumed to occur instantaneously and uniformly through each cross-section. Making these assumptions allows us to model all the flow variables as a function of distance travelled through the duct, $x$. Combining these assumptions with the ideal gas equation of state and the conservation equations for mass, momentum, and energy enables us to reduce the problem to a system of differential equations: [62]\n\n(5.3.1) $$ \\frac{\\partial N}{\\partial x} = \\left(\\frac{N}{1-N}\\right)\\left(\\frac{1+\\gamma N}{C_pT}\\right)\\left(\\frac{\\partial Q}{\\partial x}\\right) + \\left(\\frac{N}{1-N}\\right)\\left(\\frac{2+\\left(\\gamma-1\\right)N}{R_s\\,T}\\right)\\left(\\frac{\\partial F}{\\partial x}\\right) - \\left(\\frac{N}{1-N}\\right)\\left(\\frac{2+\\left(\\gamma-1\\right)N}{A}\\right)\\left(\\frac{\\partial A}{\\partial x}\\right) $$ (5.3.2) $$ \\frac{\\partial P}{\\partial x} = -\\left(\\frac{P}{1-N}\\right)\\left(\\frac{\\gamma N}{C_pT}\\right)\\left(\\frac{\\partial Q}{\\partial x}\\right) - \\left(\\frac{P}{1-N}\\right)\\left(\\frac{1+\\left(\\gamma-1\\right)N}{R_s\\,T}\\right)\\left(\\frac{\\partial F}{\\partial x}\\right) + \\left(\\frac{P}{1-N}\\right)\\left(\\frac{\\gamma N}{A}\\right)\\left(\\frac{\\partial A}{\\partial x}\\right) $$. (5.3.3) $$ \\frac{\\partial T}{\\partial x} = \\left(\\frac{T}{1-N}\\right)\\left(\\frac{1- \\gamma N}{C_pT}\\right)\\left(\\frac{\\partial Q}{\\partial x}\\right) - \\left(\\frac{T}{1-N}\\right)\\left(\\frac{\\left(\\gamma-1\\right)N}{R_s\\,T}\\right)\\left(\\frac{\\partial F}{\\partial x}\\right) + \\left(\\frac{T}{1-N}\\right)\\left(\\frac{\\left(\\gamma-1\\right) N}{A}\\right)\\left(\\frac{\\partial A}{\\partial x}\\right) $$. Consistent with previous nomenclature, $P$ and $T$ represent pressure and temperature. $\\gamma$ is the specific heat ratio and $R_s$ is the specific gas constant. These equations introduce several new variables as well. $A$ represents the cross-sectional area of the nozzle. $N$ is defined as the square of the local Mach number:\n(5.3.4) $$ N = M^2 $$The variable $Q$ accounts for heat transfer. As the hot exhaust gas flows through the nozzle it transfers energy into the nozzle walls. The walls contain cooling channels filled with cryogenic hydrogen to absorb this heat and preventing them from melting. $Q$ is a running tally of the total amount of heat transferred from the combustion gas to the nozzle walls on a per mass basis. We can visualize this by examining a small cross section of the nozzle of width $\\Delta x$.\n\nFigure 5.3.1  Fluid enters this cross section with velocity $V$ and mass flow rate $\\dot m$. As it moves through the cross section it transfers heat into the nozzle walls. This heat flux, $q$\u0026quot;, is shown in red. Heat flux has units of watts per square meter. Therefore if we multiply the heat flux by the surface area it is transmitted through we will obtain the number of watts transferred. We also know the nozzle is cylindrical with radius $r(x)$. Therefore we can calculate the relevant surface area by multiplying the cross-section\u0026rsquo;s circumference by the width $\\Delta x$. This leads to the following expression for $Q(x)$\n\n(5.3.5) $$ Q(x) =\\int_0^x \\frac{2\\,q\"(x)\\,\\pi\\,r(x)\\,dx}{\\dot m} $$ Expressions for $r(x)$ are listed in Table 5.1.2  and Equation 5.2.2. The only remaining unknown is an expression for how heat flux, $q$\u0026quot;, varies as a function of $x$. We will leave this question unsolved the moment, but will return to it shortly.\nShifting our focus back to the governing set of differential equations, we still have one additional variable to introduce: $F$. This variable represents the amount of power a theoretical pump would be required to provide in order to overcome the pressure losses associated with friction (again on a per mass basis). The amount of pressure lost as fluid travels through a pipe is also known as head loss, $h_L$. It is described by the following equation:[3]\n(5.3.6) $$ h_L = \\frac{f\\,L\\,V^2}{2\\,D\\,g} $$ $D$ is the cross-section diameter, $L$ is the length of the duct, and g is the acceleration of gravity. The amount of power required to overcome this pressure drop can be determined by multiplying $h_L$ by the mass flow rate through nozzle and the acceleration of gravity:\n(5.3.7) $$ \\text{Power}\\, =\\, h_L\\,\\dot m \\, g \\,=\\, \\frac{f\\,L\\,V^2}{2\\,D\\,g}\\, \\dot m \\, g $$ To arrive at the variable $F$ required for use in Equations 5.3.1 -5.3.3 this power requirement must be divided by the mass flow rate through the nozzle. The $\\dot m$ and $g$ terms cancel out and we reach the following conclusion:\n(5.3.8) $$ F(x) = \\frac{f\\,L\\,V^2}{2\\,D} $$ The only unfamiliar variable in this equation is the Darcy Friction factor, $f$. It is a dimensionless quantity that can be thought of as the ratio of viscous forces to inertial forces acting on the interior surface of the pipe. It is a function of the surface roughness of the pipe, and Reynolds number, $R_e$, of the flow. It can be determined by reading the Moody chart (Figure 5.3.2) or calculated by solving the Colebrook equation with an iterative root finding scheme:[63]\n \n(5.3.9) $$ \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{f}}=-2\\,\\text{log}_{10}\\left(\\frac{\\epsilon / \\,D}{3.7}+\\frac{2.51}{R_e \\, \\sqrt{f}}\\right) $$ Figure 5.3.2[64] Now we find ourselves in an interesting situation. One goal of of this section was to solve for the velocity, density, pressure, and temperature profiles through the nozzle. But in order to do this we need to solve for the friction factor, which is a function of Reynolds number. As shown above in Figure 5.3.2, Reynolds number, $R_e$, is itself a function of these flow variables. We are in a situation where we can\u0026rsquo;t solve for friction factor without knowing velocity, and we can\u0026rsquo;t solve for velocity without knowing the friction factor. To make matters worse, we still don\u0026rsquo;t have an expression for heat flux through the combustion chamber walls!\nThis brings us to the crux of the issue. Modeling the effects of entropy in a rocket combustion chamber requires a coupled analysis between a flow model and a thermal model. The flow model model predicts the properties of the combustion gas, while the thermal model analyzes the amount of heat transferred from the combustion gas to the nozzle walls and into the regenerative cooling system. Both the flow model and the thermal model must be solved simultaneously.[65]\nIn order to move forward we will assume that $Q(x) = F(x) = 0$. This eliminates many terms in Equations 5.3.1 - 5.3.3. By doing this we are left with only terms dependent on $A(x)$, which is known from Sections 5.1 and 5.2. But this is the isentropic solution described at the start of this section! This isentropic solution will be used to initiate the first first iteration of the coupled solution scheme. By setting $Q(x)$ and $F(x)$ equal to zero we obtain enough data to solve Equations 5.3.1-5.3.3 with a fourth-order Runge-Kutta algorithm.[15] We then take the resulting velocity, temperature, and pressure profiles and plug them in to the thermal analysis model described in Section 6. This analysis returns the heat flux, $q\u0026quot;(x)$, along the length of the combustion chamber. We can then return to Equations 5.3.1-5.3.3 with known velocity and flux profiles. This allows us to run the Runge-Kutta algorithm again and re-solve Equations 5.3.1-5.3.3, but this time including the $Q(x)$ and $F(x)$ terms. The resulting flow profile can then be plugged back in to the thermal model. This process is iterated until the system converges.\nResults from the initial isentropic solution are presented below. The data call-outs on the chart show properties at the injector face, throat, and nozzle exit plane.\n.tg88 {border-collapse:collapse;border-spacing:0;margin-left:26%; margin-right:20%;}     Calculated Value Actual Value Relative Error    Exit Mach Number 4.577 4.540[66]  0.8%    Exit Pressure $[Pa]$ 20,250  - -   Exit Temperature$[K]$ 1176 - -   Thrust $[lbf]$ 490,200 491,900[2] 0.34%   Specific Impulse $[sec]$ 450.3 452[2] 0.37%     Table 5.3.1  Figure 5.3.3  Figure 5.3.4  Figure 5.3.5  It is worth mentioning that the injector face temperatures and pressures shown in Figures 5.3.4 and 5.3.5 differ slightly from those listed in Table 4.5.4. The properties listed in Table 4.5.4 are stagnation values. The values used to initiate the flow model are static values which are obtained from the stagnation values by using the isentropic flow relations and Mach number at the injector face. The injector face Mach number is adjusted until the throat Mach number becomes extremely close to one. If the injector face Mach number is too small, supersonic exit velocities are never achieved. If the injector face much number is too large, shock waves will develop in the nozzle which produce discontinuities in the resulting flow field. The throat Mach number cannot be exactly one, or else the solution routine will fail completely due to the $1/(N-1)$ terms in Equations 5.3.1 - 5.3.3. The figures below show how even a small deviation from the required injector face Mach number of 0.22602 will cause the algorithm to fail.\nFigure 5.3.6:  Injector Face Mach Number =0.225 Figure 5.3.7:  Injector Face Mach Number =0.22602 Figure 5.3.8:  Injector Face Mach Number =0.227 Previous   Next   Top "},{"id":9,"href":"/regenerative-cooling-circuit/6.1-ltmcc-cooling-channels/","title":"6.1 LTMCC Cooling Channels","parent":"6.  Regenerative Cooling Circuit","content":"  MathJax = { tex: {inlineMath: [['$', '$'], ['\\\\(', '\\\\)']]} };   Regenerative Cooling  As shown in previous sections, temperatures inside the Large Throat Main Combustion Chamber (LTMCC) can exceed 3600 Kelvin. In order to withstand this harsh environment, the combustion chamber must be constructed from a material with excellent heat conduction characteristics and a high melting point. Simultaneously, this material must also have a high strength-to-weight ratio and not be too hard, tough, or brittle to complicate the manufacturing process. Engineers at North American Rockwell developed an interesting alloy to solve this problem. NARloy-Z consists primarily of copper with the addition of approximately 3% silver and 0.5% zirconium. This alloy retains copper\u0026rsquo;s excellent ability to conduct heat and improves upon its its strength and fatigue characteristics.[67] The final hurdle to overcome is melting temperature. NARLOY-Z still melts at about 1000 K, which is obviously much less than the 3600 K found inside the LTMCC. Engineers solved this problem by manufacturing a regeneratively cooled combustion chamber. Cryogenic hydrogen enters the LTMCC aft manifold and flows into a set of 430 high aspect ratio coolant passages evenly dispersed around the chamber\u0026rsquo;s circumference.[68] As coolant flows through these channels toward the nozzle injector face, the high thermal conductivity of NARloy-Z allows heat to easily pass through the walls of the chamber and be carried away by the extremely cold hydrogen. This designs maintains the wall at a temperature below its melting point while simultaneously increasing the enthalpy of the hydrogen as it is routed into the combustion chamber. The figures below show a schematic of the LTMCC regenerative cooling system, along with a plot of how channel dimensions vary along the length of the chamber. Refer to Figure 1.1.1 for a global view showing how the coolant inlet manifold (Station 8) and outlet manifold (Station 9) integrate within the SSME fuel system as a whole.\nFigure 6.1.1: LTMCC Regenerative cooling Circuit[58]   Figure 6.1.2: LTMCC Wall Channel Dimensions[69] In Section 5.3 we developed an algorithm to determine the the properties of the exhaust gas flowing through the LTMCC. We can combine this algorithm with the coolant channel geometry data shown above to initiate a coupled heat transfer analysis. There are three simultaneous equations that must be solved:[38] \n(6.1.1) $$ q_{gas}=h_{gas}A_{gas}\\left(T_{aw}-T_{hw}\\right) $$ \n(6.1.2) $$ q_{H_2}=h_{H_2}A_{H_2}\\left(T_{cw}-T_{H_2}\\right) $$ (6.1.3) $$ q_{wall}=kA_{gas}\\frac{\\partial T}{\\partial y} $$ The first two of these equations represent Newton\u0026rsquo;s Law of Cooling applied to the LTMCC. They account for convective heat transfer. Equation 6.1.1 says that the amount of heat transferred from the exhaust gas flowing through the LTMCC into the LTMCC\u0026rsquo;s inner wall ($q_{gas}$) is equal to the gas heat transfer coefficient ($h_{gas}$) multiplied by the surface area of the combustion chamber interior ($A_{gas}$) and the difference between the adiabatic wall temperature ($T_{aw}$) and the hot wall temperature, ($T_{hw}$). Adiabatic wall temperature is the temperature that would exist on the inner wall of the LTMCC if the wall was perfectly insulated and no heat transfer was possible. The \u0026ldquo;hot wall\u0026rdquo; temperature, $T_{hw}$, is the true temperature of the inner surface of the LTMCC.\nEquation 6.1.2 is Newton\u0026rsquo;s law of cooling applied to one of the hydrogen coolant channels. $q_{H_{2}}$ is the total amount of heat transferred from the channel walls into the liquid hydrogen coolant. $h$ represents the convective heat transfer coefficient and $A$ is the wetted surface area of the cooling channel. $T_{H_2}$ is the bulk temperature of the liquid hydrogen flowing through the channel. $T_{cw}$ is the temperature of the \u0026ldquo;cold wall,\u0026rdquo; the the bottom surface of the cooling cooling channel. The cold wall and the hot wall of the LTMCC are separated by the \u0026ldquo;thickness\u0026rdquo; shown above in Figures 6.1.1 and 6.1.2.\nThe final equation is Fourier\u0026rsquo;s Law. It accounts for heat conduction between the hot wall and cold wall. $k$ is the thermal conductivity of the NARloy wall. $A$ is the surface area of the wall, and $\\partial T / \\partial y$ is the temperature gradient between the hot and cold walls.\nAs the exhaust gas flows down the nozzle, heat is transferred from the gas into the hot wall. All of this heat is conducted through the hot wall and into they hydrogen coolant. Therefore $q_{gas}=q_{wall}=q_{H_2}$. Solving these three simultaneous equations will reveal the wall temperature profile from the injector face to the nozzle exit plane, and provide the expression for $Q(x)$ needed to close the system of \u0026ldquo;quasi one-dimensional\u0026rdquo; flow equations established in Section 5.3. We will begin by refining the expression for the amount of heat transferred from the combustion gas into the chamber wall: Equation 6.1.1.\nEquation 6.1.1 The geometry of the LTMCC is known from Section 5.1 which facilitates calculation of the chamber\u0026rsquo;s inner surface area, $A_{gas}$. Table 5.1.2 provides the radius of the LTMCC at any given station along the length of the LTMCC. If we discretize the LTMCC into a finite number of segments of width $dx$ (as shown in Figure5.3.1), the surface area of an segment $dx$ is simply that of a cylinder:\n\n(6.1.4) $$ A_{gas}= \\frac{2\\pi\\,r(x)\\,dx}{N_{cc}} $$  The $N_{cc}$ term in the denominator of this equation represents the number of cooling channels the arrayed around the cylinder\u0026rsquo;s circumference. We will perform this analysis and estimate the amount of heat transferred in a single cooling channel. Therefore the surface area contained in the numerator is divided by the number of cooling channels, in this case 430.\nThe convective heat transfer coefficient, $h_{gas}$ is significantly more complex to model. We turn to the Bartz Equation:[70]\n\n(6.1.5) $$ h_{gas}= \\frac{0.026}{D_t^2}\\left(\\frac{\\eta^{0.2}\\,C_p}{P_r^{0.6}}\\right)\\left(\\frac{p_c}{c^*}\\right)^{0.8}\\left(\\frac{D_t}{R_U}\\right)^{0.1}\\left(\\frac{A_t}{A}\\right)^{0.9}\\,\\sigma$$  $$ \\sigma = \\frac{1}{\\left[\\frac{1}{2}\\frac{T_{hw}}{T_s}\\left(1+\\frac{\\gamma-1}{2}\\,M^2\\right)+\\frac{1}{2}\\right]^{0.68}\\left[1+\\frac{\\gamma-1}{2}M^2\\right]^{0.12}}$$  Solving this equation requires the use of nearly every function described in the previous sections of this website. Table 6.1.1 names each variable and provides a cross-reference to the additional equations needed to perform the calculation.\n.tg {border-collapse:collapse;border-spacing:0;margin-left:26%; margin-right:20%;} .tg td{border-color:black;border-style:solid;border-width:1px;font-family:Arial, sans-serif;font-size:14px; overflow:hidden;padding:10px 5px;word-break:normal;} .tg th{border-color:black;border-style:solid;border-width:1px;font-family:Arial, sans-serif;font-size:14px; font-weight:normal;overflow:hidden;padding:10px 5px;word-break:normal;} .tg .tg-0lax{text-align:left;vertical-align:top}    Variable Name Calculation Procedure     $D_t$ LTMCC Throat Diameter Figure 5.1.10    $\\eta$ Combustion Gas Viscosity Equation 2.6.13    $C_p$ Combustion Gas Specific Heat Equation 2.4.1   $\\lambda$ Combustion Gas Thermal Conductivity Equation 2.6.12   $Pr$ Combustion Gas Prandtl Number $\\frac{C_p\\,\\eta}{\\lambda}$ Section 2.6   $p_c$  Stagnation Pressure Eqns 5.3.1 - 5.3.3   $c^*$ Characteristic Velocity Equation 3.4.1   $R_U$ Wall Radius of Curvature at Throat Figure 5.1.11   $A$ Cross-Sectional Area at Station $x$  Table 5.1.2   $A_t$ Throat Cross-Sectional Area  Figure 5.1.10   $T_s$ Stagnation Temperature Eqns 5.3.1 - 5.3.3   $\\gamma$ Combustion Gas Specific Heat Ratio Section 3.3   $M$ Mach Number Eqns 5.3.1 - 5.3.3     Table 6.1.1  The heat transfer coefficient predicted by the Bartz equation is very sensitive to the hot gas transport properties (viscosity, $\\eta$, and thermal conductivity, $\\lambda$) used as inputs. The models for these transport properties developed in Section 2.6 provide accurate results, as long provided they are provided the correct temperature to initiate the calculation. This raises the question, what is the correct temperature to calculate the hot gas transport properties at? Should the free-stream hot gas temperature be used? Or the temperature of the hot wall? The difference between these two temperatures can be on the order of several thousand Kelvin, which will drastically alter the the results returned by the transport property models. To resolve this problem a \u0026ldquo;reference temperature,\u0026rdquo; $T^*$, is utilized:[17]\n\n(6.1.5a) $$ \\frac{T^*}{T}=1+0.032\\,M^2+0.58\\left(\\frac{T_{hw}}{T}-1\\right)$$ where $T$ and $M$ correspond to the free stream temperature and Mach number of the combustion gas.\nEvaluating the hot gas transport properties at $T^*$ gives good results. But this raises yet another question. Must a similiar method be used account for transport properties of the liquid hydrogen in the coolant channels? What temperature should those properties be calculated at? Again, there can be a significant difference between the bulk tempertuare of the fluid (50-300 K) and the cold wall temperature (400-600 K). In this case a \u0026ldquo;film temperature,\u0026rdquo; $T_f$ is used to calculate transport properties:\n\n(6.1.5b) $$ T_f =\\frac{T_{cw}+T_{H_{2}}}{2}$$ Returning to Equation 6.1.1, there is still one more variable requiring elaboration: adiabatic wall temperature, $T_{aw}$.[38]\n(6.1.6) $$ T_{aw} = T_{s}\\frac{1+P_r^{0.33}\\left(\\frac{\\gamma-1}{2}\\right)\\,M^2}{1+\\left(\\frac{\\gamma-1}{2}\\right)\\,M^2} $$ Equation 6.1.2 After defining all of the variables needed to account for the heat transferred from the combustion gas, we are ready to move on to Equation 6.1.2 and account for how this heat is absorbed by liquid hydrogen flowing through the LTMCC cooling channels. The first variable of interest in Equation 6.1.2 is $h_{H_2}$, the liquid hydrogen heat transfer coefficient. It is defined as follows:\n(6.1.7) $$ h_{H_2}=\\frac{Nu\\,D_h}{\\lambda_{H_2}}$$ where $D_h$ is the hydraulic diameter of the cooling channel and $Nu$ is the local Nusselt Number. Nusselt number is a quantity that describes the ratio of conductive heat transfer to convective heat transfer into the hydrogen coolant.[71] It is modelled by the following correlation for hydrogen: [72] [73]\n(6.1.8) $$ Nu = \\frac{\\left(f/8\\right)R_e\\,P_r\\frac{T_{H_2}}{T_{cw}}^{0.55}}{\\left(1+\\left(f/8\\right)^{0.55}\\left[B\\left(\\epsilon^*\\right)-8.48\\right]\\right)}\\,C_1\\,C_2\\,C_3$$ The variables $f$ and $R_e$ represent the local friction factor and Reynold\u0026rsquo;s number in the cooling channel. These values can be determined through use of Equation 5.3.9  and Figure 5.3.2 .\n$B\\left(\\epsilon^*\\right)$ is a piecewise function:\n(6.1.9) $$ \\epsilon^*=R_e\\left(e/D_h\\right)\\left(f/8\\right)^{0.5}$$ (6.1.10) $$ B\\left(\\epsilon^*\\right)=4.7\\left(\\epsilon^*\\right)^{0.2}\\,\\,\\,\\,\\text{for}\\,\\, \\epsilon^* \\geq 7 $$ (6.1.11) $$ B\\left(\\epsilon^*\\right)=4.5+0.57\\left(\\epsilon^*\\right)^{0.75}\\,\\,\\,\\,\\text{for}\\,\\, \\epsilon^* The coefficients $C_1$, $C_2$, and $C_3$ account for wall surface roughness, effects in the thermal entrance region, and secondary flows due to channel curvature, respectively.[74]\n(6.1.12) $$ C_1 =\\frac{1+1.5P_r^{-1/6}R_e^{-1/8}\\left(P_r-1\\right)\\xi}{1+1.5P_r^{-1/6}R_e^{-1/8}\\left(P_r\\xi-1\\right)} $$ In the above equations, the variable $\\xi$ is the ratio of rough wall friction factor to smooth wall friction factor. These friction factors can be evaluated with Equation 5.3.9  and Figure 5.3.2 . For these calculations, the average surface roughness of the channel wall, $e$ is required. For NARloy-Z, $e$ is approximately $2.5\\times10^{-7}$ meters.[69]\n(6.1.13) $$ C_2 =1+\\left(\\frac{s}{D_h}\\right)^{-0.7}\\left(\\frac{T_{cw}}{T_{H_2}}\\right)^{0.1} $$ \nThe variable $s$ in Equation 6.1.13 represents the linear distance hydrogen has flowed since entering the cooling channel at the inlet manifold.\n(6.1.14) $$ C_3 =\\left[R_e\\left(\\frac{0.25\\,D_h}{R}\\right)^2\\right]^{\\pm0.05} $$ The variable $R$ in Equation 6.1.14 represents channel wall\u0026rsquo;s radius of curvature at station $x$. The exponent values correspond to the sign of the local concavity. The variable $C_3$ is only applied to stations where the wall curvature has a finite value (i.e. the curved regions corresponding to $R_I$, $R_U$, and $R_D$ on Figure 5.1.11)\nThe final term of interest in Equation 6.1.2 is $A_{H_2}$, which represents the wetted surface area of the channel interior. Each channel has a rectangular cross section of width $W$ and height $H$ (see Figure 6.1.1). As was done for the LTMCC interior surface in Equation 6.1.4, the cooling will be discretized channel into multiple segments of length $dx$. Therefore the wetted surface area of each channel segment becomes:\n(6.1.15) $$ A_{H_2} = \\left(2H+2W\\right)dx $$ This expression for surface area does not quite tell the entire story. Equation 6.1.2 shows that the temperature difference between the channel\u0026rsquo;s cold wall ($T_{cw}$) and the bulk temperature of the hydrogen coolant ($T_{H_2}$) is the primary factor driving the convective heat transfer. If the assumption is made that the entire surface $A_{H_2}$ is maintained at the cold wall temperature $T_{cw}$ the model will greatly over-predict the amount of heat transferred into the hydrogen coolant. We must account for the temperature distribution due to conduction along the channel\u0026rsquo;s walls. This is accomplished by approximating the vertical walls of the channel as thin rectangular fins. The \u0026ldquo;thin\u0026rdquo; assumption implies that temperature distribution along the length of each vertical channel wall is one-dimensional. The vertical walls will have a temperature of $T_{cw}$ at their base, and this temperature will decay as a function of height, $H$, above the bottom of the coolant channel. We will also make the assumption that the upper surface of the channel is well insulated. This means that there is no heat flux through the top of the coolant channel. The figure below provides a depiction of this heat transfer model with red arrows depicting flux.\nFigure 6.1.3: Convective Heat Transfer Model  In order to determine the heat flux into the hydrogen coolant we must derive expressions for the temperature profiles along the channel\u0026rsquo;s two vertical walls and its horizontal base. The horizontal wall is easy. We assume it stays at a uniform temperature of $T_{cw}$. The temperature distribution up the vertical walls takes a bit more work. Returning to the \u0026ldquo;thin fin\u0026rdquo; assumption, Fourier\u0026rsquo;s law of conduction can be used to establish a differential equation for the temperature of the vertical wall at a distance $y$ above the channel floor:[75]\n(6.1.16) $$ \\frac{d^2 T}{d y^2}+\\left(\\frac{1}{A_c}\\frac{d A_c}{dy}\\right)\\frac{dT}{dy}-\\left(\\frac{1}{A_c}\\frac{h_{H2}}{k}\\frac{dA_s}{dy}\\right)\\left(T-T_{H_2}\\right)=0$$ The areas $A_c$ and $A_s$ in Equation 6.1.16 correspond to the cross-sectional area and surface area of the vertical wall. The vertical wall has a rectangular profile, so $A_c$ is simply $\\delta dx$. $A_s$ is the surface area of the vertical wall that is exposed to the hydrogen coolant. Remembering to account for both sides of the wall, the expression for $A_s$ then $2\\cdot y \\cdot dx$.\nThis differential equation is subject to the following boundary conditions:\n$$ T\\left(0\\right)=T_{cw}$$ $$ \\frac{dT}{dy}\\biggr\\rvert_{y=H}=0$$ Equation 6.1.16 can be solved analytically for simple geometries such as a rectangular fin with uniform cross-section. Reference [75] contains a detailed procedure on how to perform this calculation. We will neglect the details and skip directly to the results. The solution to Equation 6.1.16 gives the temperature profile of the vertical channel wall from $y=0$ to $y=H$. Using this temperature profile, a \u0026ldquo;fin efficiency\u0026rdquo; can be established that will serve as a correction factor for the surface area described in Equation 6.1.12. The efficiency of a thin rectangular fin is modelled as follows:\n(6.1.17) $$ \\eta_{fin} = \\frac{\\text{tanh}\\left(mL_c\\right)}{mL_c}$$ (6.1.18) $$ m = sqrt(\\frac{2\\,h_{H2}}{k\\,\\delta})$$ In Equation 6.1.18, $k$ is the thermal conductivity of NARloy-Z, 316 $W/m\\cdot K$,[69], and $\\delta$ is the width of the vertical channel wall, as shown above on Figure 6.1.3. The length $L_c$ is the \u0026ldquo;corrected\u0026rdquo; length of the vertical wall used to impose the adiabatic tip boundary condition:[75]\n(6.1.19) $$ L_c = H+\\delta/2$$ Now that we have the efficiency of the thin rectangular fin serving as the channel wall, we can return to Equation 6.1.15 and update the expression for the inner surface area of the coolant channel. We made the assumption that upper surface of the channel is well insulated. This means we can remove the area of the upper surface from this calculation. The vertical walls are not at a uniform temperature, but we can correct for this by multiplying their surface area by the fin efficiency calculated with Equation 6.1.15. The final expression for $A_{H_2}$ then becomes:\n(6.1.20) $$ A_{H_2} = \\left(2\\eta_{fin}H+W\\right)dx $$  Equation 6.1.3 Equations 6.1.1 and 6.1.2 accounted for convective heat transfer in the LTMCC. The final heat transfer equation to be discussed, Equation 6.1.3, accounts for conductive heat transfer between the \u0026ldquo;hot\u0026rdquo; and \u0026ldquo;cold\u0026rdquo; walls of the LTMCC. The hot wall is the inner surface of the chamber that is exposed to the combustion gas. The cold wall is the bottom surface of the hydrogen coolant channel. These walls are separated by the \u0026ldquo;thickness\u0026rdquo; shown in Figures 6.1.1 and 6.1.3. Fortunately Equation 6.1.3 does not require nearly as much elaboration as the two previous convective equations! There is only one new variable to introduce: the temperature gradient between the hot and cold surfaces.\n(6.1.21) $$ \\frac{\\partial T}{\\partial y}=\\frac{T_{hw}-T_{cw}}{thickness} $$ Solution Procedure We now have enough information to solve the governing heat transfer relationships established with Equations 6.1.1 - 6.1.3. The first law of thermodynamics says that energy must be conserved. Therefore $q_{gas}=q_{H_2}=q_{wall}$. In these equations (and all of the sub-equations required to complete them), the only unknown variables are are the hot and cold wall temperatures, $T_{hw}$ and $T_{cw}$. We can establish a system of two equations and solve for these two unknowns using a multi-variable Newton-Raphson algorithm:\n\n(6.1.22) $$ f_1: q_{H_2}-q_{gas} =0 $$ (6.1.23) $$ f_2:\\,\\, q_{H_2}-q_{wall} =0 $$ This algorithm requires differentiating $f_1$ and $f_2$ with respect to both $T_{cw}$ and $T_{hw}$. Due to all of the linked equations that go in to $f_1$ and $f_2$ it is not practical to derive an analytic solution. These derivatives must be calculated numerically. Fortunately this is an identical procedure to that described for the combustion model in Section 3.3.\nThe algorithm is initiated by dividing the axis of the LTMCC into 200 increments of length $dx$. An isentropic solution for the combustion gas flow through the nozzle is then computed using the procedure described in Section 5.3. The resulting gas properties at each station $dx$ are then input into the heat transfer model described in this section. The initial temperature of the liquid hydrogen entering the coolant inlet manifold at Station 8 is known. This temperature is assumed to remain constant over the length of the first channel segment $dx$. The Newton-Raphson algorithm will guess values for $T_{cw}$ and $T_{hw}$ until the residuals of Equations 6.1.22 and 6.1.23 converge sufficiently close to zero, indicating the correct wall temperatures have been reached. The coolant temperature entering station $dx_{i+1}$ is then calculated as follows:[73]\n\n(6.1.24) $$ T_{H_2,\\ i+1} = T_{H_2,\\ i} + \\Delta T $$ (6.1.24 a) $$ \\Delta T = \\frac{q_{H_2}}{\\dot m_{H_2}/ Ncc} C_p $$  where $\\dot m_{H_2}$ is the mass flow rate of hydrogen entering the coolant inlet manifold (13.2 kg/s for the LTMCC at 104.5% power), $C_p$ represents isobaric heat capacity, and $N_{cc}$ is the number of coolant channels arrayed round the perimeter of the chamber (430 for the LTMCC or 390 for the STMCC).\nThe pressure drop between coolant stations, $\\Delta P$ , is calculated as follows:[73]\n(6.1.25) $$ \\Delta P = \\Delta P_1 + \\Delta P_2 +\\Delta P_3 $$. $\\Delta P_1$ accounts for \u0026ldquo;major losses\u0026rdquo; from viscous pressure drop due to the surface roughness of the channel walls:\n(6.1.26) $$ \\Delta P_1 = \\frac{f\\,\\rho\\,V^2\\,dx}{2D_h} $$. $\\Delta P_2$ accounts for \u0026ldquo;minor losses\u0026rdquo; due to expansion and contraction of the cooling channel hydraulic diameter:\n(6.1.27) $$ \\Delta P_2 = \\frac{K\\,\\rho\\,V^2}{2} $$ where the value of $K$ depends on the contraction or expansion ratio moving upstream into the next channel section $dx$. For expansions:\n(6.1.28) $$ K =\\left[\\frac{D_{h_{i}}}{D_{h_{i+1}}}^2-1\\right]^2 $$ For contractions:\n(6.1.29) $$ K = 0.5 - 0.167\\frac{D_{h_{i+1}}}{D_{h_{i}}}-0.125\\frac{D_{h_{i+1}}}{D_{h_{i}}}^2-0.208\\frac{D_{h_{i+1}}}{D_{h_{i}}}^3 $$ $\\Delta P_3$ models changes in pressure due to fluid acceleration:\n\n(6.1.30) $$ \\Delta P_3 = \\left[\\frac{2}{\\left(A_i\\,N_{cc}\\right)+\\left(A_{i+1}\\,N_{cc}\\right)}\\right]\\left[\\frac{1}{\\rho\\,A_{i}\\,N_{cc}}-\\frac{1}{\\rho\\,A_{i+1}\\,N_{cc}}\\right]\\,\\dot m^2 $$ where $A_i$ corresponds to the cross-sectional area of the coolant channel at station $dx_i$\nThe hydrogen coolant pressure at the next station upstream is then calculated as follows:\n\n(6.1.31) $$ P_{H_{2},\\ i+1} = P_{H_{2},\\ i} - \\Delta P $$ This entire process is repeated at the next channel segment, $dx_{i+1}$ using temperatures $T_{hw}$ and $T_{cw}$ at station $dx_{i}$ as the initial guess to initiate the Newton algorithm. Typically about 30 iterations are required to obtain convergence at each segment $dx$. After the wall temperature and flux profiles have been determined along the length of the entire LTMCC axis, the program returns to the compressible flow model in Section 5.3 and solves for $Q(x)$ with Equation 5.3.5. The flow model (Equations 5.3.1 - 5.3.3) is then re-solved with the the $Q(x)$ terms included. This results in new hot gas flow properties along the the length of the chamber. These flow properties are then imported back in to the heat transfer model described in this section, and the entire process is iterated until global convergence is obtained. Flow properties at the exit of the LTMCC are then used to initiate both the gas flow model and heat transfer model downstream of the nozzle attach flange (see Figures 5.1.11 and 5.2.5). Results for the nozzle proper are presented in the following section.\nResults Most literature presents data for the Standard Throat Main Combustion Chamber (STMCC) operating at the Full Power Level (FPL) of 109%, rather than the Large Throat Main Combustion Chamber (LTMCC) studied in this analysis at the Nominal Power Level (NPL) of 104.5%. In order to validate the LTMCC model developed on this website it was first necessary to generate results corresponding to STMCC geometry and inlet conditions at 109%. Plots of the temperature, heat flux, and heat transfer coefficient in the STMCC predicted by this model at 109% power level are shown below. Table 6.1.2 contains predictions from literature for comparison.\nFigure 6.1.4: STMCC Wall Temperatures at 109%. Spikes in temperature correspond to changes in channel geometry.

Nevertheless, the results from the model developed on this website fall in line with the general trends reported in from these references, which provides high confidence in the accuracy of the model. The Betti and Pizzarelli models both state that their predicted maximum wall temperatures are significantly higher than expected. The wall temperature reported by Naraghi is significantly less than the value reported by Wang. The Naraghi model appears to predict higher the coolant pressure drop and temperature increase as compared to the other models. The model developed on this website tends to under predict coolant pressure drop, but provides a very reasonable estimate of coolant temperature increase. Both $\\Delta P$ and $\\Delta T$ are sensitive to the surface roughness of the coolant channel walls. Surface roughness, $e$, is used to calculate the friction factor, $f$ in both the Nusselt number correlation (Equation 6.1.8) used for heat transfer and the model for \u0026ldquo;major\u0026rdquo; pressure losses due to friction (Equation 6.1.26). Unfortunately consistent data about the surface roughness of NARloy-Z is difficult to find. Values can range from 0.1-0.5 micrometers.[69] This model uses 0.25 micrometers as a representative example. $\\Delta P$ increases as $e$ moves toward the upper end of this range.\nThe final step in validating this model was to verify that the liquid hydrogen equation of state (Equation 2.1.7) returned accurate results for thermodynamic properties along the length of the coolant channel. There are significant axial temperature and pressure gradients along the cooling channel, and it was necessary to verify that the results produced by Equation 2.1.7 were free of discontinuities along the length of the passage. The figures below plot density and specific heat as function of axial position. The equation of state appears to return accurate results along along the entire regime of predicted temperatures and pressures. It interesting to note that in the coolant channels liquid hydrogen is highly compressible and displays a large variation in specific heat.\nFigure 6.1.9: Coolant Isobaric Heat Capacity  Figure 6.1.10: Coolant Density After validating that the model on this website produces results in good agreement with published values, the next step was to re-run the analysis for the large throat configuration at the 104% power level. The following plots compare results from the large throat and small throat configurations.\nFigure 6.1.11: LT and ST MCC Hot Wall Temperatures. Spikes in temperature correspond to changes in channel geometry.

Adding 40 additional coolant channels and increasing the cross-sectional area of throat area by 12 percent allows the LTMCC to operate at a \u0026ldquo;greatly reduced\u0026rdquo;[56] temperature and heat flux as compared to the standard throat configuration.\nPrevious   Next   Top "},{"id":10,"href":"/regenerative-cooling-circuit/6.2-nozzle-coolant-tubes/","title":"6.2 Nozzle Coolant Tubes","parent":"6.  Regenerative Cooling Circuit","content":"  MathJax = { tex: {inlineMath: [['$', '$'], ['\\\\(', '\\\\)']]} };   Nozzle Coolant Tubes  After departing the LTMCC, the hot combustion gas flows past the nozzle attach flange and enters the nozzle proper. Although temperatures and heat flux are greatly reduced in the nozzle as compared to the LTMCC, wall thermal limits are still an important design consideration. To keep wall temperatures in check, the nozzle utilizes a regenerative cooling system very similar to the LTMCC. Cryogenic hydrogen is routed down the exterior of the nozzle through the three transfer ducts depicted below in Figure 6.2.1. The transfer ducts distribute the hydrogen into the coolant inlet manifold that encircles the nozzle exit plane. From this manifold, coolant enters a network of 1080 parallel tubes arrayed circumferentially around the nozzle bell.[67] These coolant tubes form the shell of the nozzle itself. Nine circumferential hatbands enable this \u0026ldquo;tubular wall\u0026rdquo; design to maintain structural rigidity. The hydrogen coolant flows up these tubes from the inlet manifold (Station 6) until it reaches the outlet manifold at the nozzle attach flange (Station 7). Refer to Figure 1.1.1 for a schematic that depicts how this cooling system integrates into the SSME fuel system as a whole.\nFigure 6.2.1: Nozzle Cooling System [78], [79]   Figure 6.2.2: Tubular Wall Design [80], [81]   A similar approach to that described in the previous section can be used in order to predict wall temperature and heat flux as a function of axial position down the length of the nozzle. The first step in the analysis requires defining the geometry of the coolant tubes. Unfortunately, there is very little published data describing the dimensions of these tubes, which drives the analysis to begin with several geometrical assumptions. First, it is assumed that the outer radius of each individual coolant tube ${r_{t}}$ is sized to touch tangentially with both its neighboring tubes and with an arc representing the inner circumference of the nozzle bell:\nFigure 6.2.3: Tube Geometry  Equation 5.2.2  provides the radius of the nozzle bell, $r_n$, as a function of axial distance from the injector face. Using this information, the outer radius of each coolant tube can be determined with the law of cosines:\n(6.2.1) $$\\frac{r_t^2}{\\left(r_n+r_t\\right)^2}=\\frac{1}{2}\\left(1-\\text{cos}\\,\\theta\\right) $$ The angle $\\theta$ is determined by diving $2\\pi$ by the number of coolant tubes, in this case 1080.\nNext, the the thickness, $t$, of the coolant tube walls is assumed. It is desirable to keep this thickness as small as possible in order to minimize both nozzle weight and wall temperatures. NASA recommends that wall thickness should not be decreased below 0.254 mm, even if a stress analysis indicates a smaller thickness is theoretically feasible. Design history has shown that decreasing wall thickness below this critical value tends to result in tube failure due to the presence of small flaws and granular effects in the material itself.[81] As an initial guess, tube thickness in this model is assumed to be constant at 0.254 mm along the length of the nozzle. The length of the inner radius was then calculated by subtracting the tube thickness from the outer radius. The figure below plots these radii as a function of axial position.\nFigure 6.2.4:  Tube Radii   Heat Transfer Model  A similar approach to that described in Section 6.1 is used to predict the tube wall temperature, coolant temperature increase, and coolant pressure drop. Two of the same three fundamental equations apply, and are reprinted below:\n(6.1.1) $$ q_{gas}=h_{gas}A_{gas}\\left(T_{aw}-T_{hw}\\right) $$ (6.1.2) $$ q_{H_2}=h_{H_2}A_{H_2}\\left(T_{cw}-T_{H_2}\\right) $$ There are a few slight differences in how these equations are implemented. Starting with Equation 6.1.1, we must devise a new expression for $A_{gas}$. This is the surface area of the coolant tube exposed to the hot gas inside the combustion chamber:\n(6.2.2) $$ A_{gas}= \\pi\\,r_t\\,dx $$  This equation describes the surface area of one-half of a cylinder with length $dx$ and radius $r_t$. The combustion gas heat transfer coefficient, $h_{gas}$, remains as defined by Equation 6.1.5.\nMoving on to Equation 6.1.2, new expressions are required for both $h_{h_{2}}$ and $A_{h_{2}}$. $A_{h_{2}}$ represents the surface area of the coolant tube interior through which heat transfer is occurring. Since only one side of the coolant tube is exposed to the hot gas in the combustion chamber, an expression for one-half the surface area of a cylinder is used again. It is important to note that the radius in the following expression is the inner radius of the tube. The length of the inner radius is simply the length of the outer radius minus the wall thickness $t$, which in this case is 0.254 mm.\n(6.2.3) $$ A_{H_{2}}= \\pi\\,(r_t-t)\\,dx $$  The heat transfer coefficient is calculated in an identical manner to that shown in Section 6.1, but this team a different Nusselt number correlation is used:[82]\n(6.2.4) $$ N_u= 0.062\\,R_e^{0.7}\\,P_r^{0.4\\,}C_{1}\\,C_2\\,C_3$$  The $C$ coefficients remain as defined in the previous section.\nAs was done for the LTMCC, the final equation required to close the system is Fourier\u0026rsquo;s Law. In the previous section, heat transfer between the hot and cold sides of the LTMCC was approximated as conduction through a plane wall. This approximation was valid because the width of each coolant channel was small compared to the radius of curvature of the LTMCC inner wall. In the nozzle proper, the width of each cooling channel ($2r_t$) is on the same order of magnitude as tube\u0026rsquo;s radius of curvature ($r_t$) . An expression for conduction through one-half of a cylindrical wall must be utilized.[75]\n(6.2.5) $$ q_{wall} = \\frac{\\pi\\,dx\\,k_{wall}\\left(T_{hw}-T_{cw}\\right)}{\\text{ln}\\left(\\frac{r_t}{r_t-t}\\right)}$$  Equations 6.1.1, 6.1.2, and 6.2.4 can be combined into the following system of equations, which is solved utilizing the same procedure as in Section 6.1.\n\n(6.2.6) $$ f_1: q_{H_2}-q_{gas} =0 $$ (6.2.7) $$ f_2:\\,\\, q_{H_2}-q_{wall} =0 $$ In the above equations, it is once again very important to pay close attention to the temperatures at which thermodynamic and transport properties are evaluated. Transport properties for the hot combustion gas were calculated at the reference temperature $T^*$ described by Equation 6.1.5a. Transport properties of liquid hydrogen were calculated at the film temperaure $T_f$ shown in Equation 6.1.5b. Thermodynamic properties for both fluids were calculated at the bulk temperature.\nCoolant pressure drop and temperature increase were determined with Equations 6.1.24 through 6.1.30. Once again, these quantities were computed for each tube segment $dx$.\n Stress Analysis  Next, a stress analysis was performed to validate the choice of tube dimensions. There are two two tangential stresses that must be taken into consideration: thermal stress due to heat flux, and hoop stress due to coolant pressure. These stresses are modeled by Equation 6.2.8:[38]\n(6.2.8) $$\\sigma_1 = \\frac{\\left(P_{H_{2}}-P_{g}\\right)r_t}{t} +\\frac{E\\,\\alpha\\,q^\"\\,t}{2\\left(1-\\nu\\right)k} $$ The variables $P_{H_{2}}$ and $P_g$ in the first term correspond to the pressure of the hydrogen coolant in the tubes and the pressure of the combustion gas flowing through the nozzle. Both of these values vary along the length of the nozzle. The largest coolant pressures occurs at the exit plane, and the largest combustion gas pressure occurs at the nozzle attach flange. The second term accounts for thermal stress due to the heat flux, $q^\u0026quot;$, through the tube walls. The remaining variables in this term correspond to material properties. The tubes are manufactured from A286 stainless steel.[67] Material properties are tabulated below.[83] Note that several of these properties are functions of temperature. These properties were evaluated at the average temperature between the hot and cold tube walls at each segment $dx$.\n.tg990 {border-collapse:collapse;border-spacing:0; margin-left:10%; margin-right:10%;} .tg td{border-color:black;border-style:solid;border-width:1px;font-family:Arial, sans-serif;font-size:14px; overflow:hidden;padding:10px 5px;word-break:normal;} .tg th{border-color:black;border-style:solid;border-width:1px;font-family:Arial, sans-serif;font-size:14px; font-weight:normal;overflow:hidden;padding:10px 5px;word-break:normal;} .tg .tg-18eh{border-color:#000000;font-weight:bold;text-align:center;vertical-align:middle} .tg .tg-xwyw{border-color:#000000;text-align:center;vertical-align:middle}    Property Symbol Value     Elastic Modulus $E$ $-7.957\\times10^7\\left(\\frac{T_{hw}+T_{cw}}{2}\\right)+2.25\\times10^{11}$ $Pa$    Coefficient of Themal Expansion  $\\alpha$  $17\\times10^{-6} $ $1/K$   Poisson Ratio  $\\nu$  $0.33$    Thermal Conductivity  $k$ $1.93148\\times10^{-2}\\frac{(T_{hw}+T_{cw})}{2}+6.89313$ $\\frac{W}{m-K}$     Table 6.2.1  Additionally, a longitudinal thermal stress, $\\sigma_2$, exists due to the temperature difference between the hot and cold sides of the tube:\n(6.2.9) $$\\sigma_2 = E\\,\\alpha\\Delta T $$ where $\\Delta T$ represents the average temperature difference between the hot and cold halves of the tube. These stresses are depicted below on Figure 6.2.5.\nFigure 6.2.5: Tube Stress Note that there are no shear stresses present and $\\sigma_1$ and $\\sigma_2$ are orthogonal. Therefore these are principle stresses that can be used in conjunction with distortion energy theory to predict the effective stress at which failure will occur:[81]\n(6.2.10) $$\\sigma_{eff} = \\frac{\\sqrt{2}}{2}\\sqrt{\\left(\\sigma_1-\\sigma_2\\right)^2+\\left(\\sigma_2-\\sigma_3\\right)^2+\\left(\\sigma_3-\\sigma_1\\right)^2} $$ This analysis assumes there is no axial stress acting along the length of the tube (i.e. $\\sigma_3=0$).\nNASA recommends designing the tubes for a rupture strength based on the maximum expected hot wall temperature and desired operating life. [81] The SSME operational life is designed to last 7.5 hours [84] at a maximum sustained temperature of 1000 F[2]. At this temperature, A286 steel can withstand a maximum stress of 690 MPa for up to 10 hours prior to rupture.[83] Therefore a factor of safety was calculated by dividing 690 MPa by the effective stress, $\\sigma_{eff}$. Failure is not expected to occur when this ratio is greater than one.\nAn iterative process was used to calculate this factor of safety down the length of each tube. First, the hot gas flow model through the nozzle was run using the procedure described in Section 5.3. This provided $P_g$ as a function of axial position. Next, the nozzle heat transfer model described above was used to compute tube heat flux, $q^\u0026quot;$, coolant pressure, $P_{H_{2}}$, and the hot and cold wall temperatures as a function of axial position. These results were input into Equations 6.2.3 - 6.2.5, along with the tube wall thickness. After completing these calculations along the length of the tube, the resulting temperature and flux profiles were plugged back in to the compressible flow model described in Section 5.3. This allowed the hot gas flow calculations (Equations 5.3.1 - 5.3.3) to be be repeated with the $Q(x)$ terms included to account for the effects of entropy. The resulting hot gas flow profile was then imported back into the heat transfer model described in this section, and the entire process was iterated until global convergence was obtained. Initial results assuming constant tube dimensions along the length of the nozzle are presented below.\nFigure 6.2.6:  Heat Flux  Figure 6.2.7:  Wall Temperatures  These plots display several interesting trends. First, note that the domain of the plots begin at $x =$0.64 meters (25.19 inches), rather than 0. This is in line with the global coordinate system established in Section 5.1. $x =$0 corresponds to the combustion chamber injector face. The nozzle itself begins 25.19 inches downstream from the injector face. Refer to Figure 5.2.5.\nWhen progressing upstream from the nozzle exit plane toward the throat both heat flux and wall temperature increase as expected. The large flux near the nozzle attach flange drives the thermal stress $\\sigma_1$ and effective stress $\\sigma_{eff}$ to increase above 690 MPa. In turn, this causes the factor of safety against rupture to drop below one, implying tube failure at all $x$ values less than approximately 0.71 m. These trends are plotted below on Figures 6.2.8 and 6.2.9.\nFigure 6.2.8:  Stress Analysis  Figure 6.2.9:  Factor of Safety  An additional problem arises when examining hydrogen pressure as it flows up the length of the nozzle. As shown below in Figure 6.2.10, pressure drops excessively for x values less than 1. This is due to the fact that the tube inner radius has contracted significantly compared to its size at the exit plane (see Figure 6.2.4). The mass flow rate through these tubes must remain constant. This implies that fluid velocity must increase, as shown below on Figure 6.2.11. As velocity increases, pressure drops in accordance with Equation 6.1.30.\nFigure 6.2.10:  Coolant Pressure  Figure 6.2.11:  Coolant Velocity  After departing the nozzle, the coolant must retain sufficient pressure to flow into the pre-burner combustion chambers, which are pressurized to 33 MPa. The model here here shows that the output cooling jacket output pressure is not sufficient to meet this requirement. Coolant tube re-design is required in order to reduce the pressure drop and increase the factor of safety against rupture.\nThe easiest way to minimize pressure drop would be to increase the coolant tube radius. Unfortunately since tube radius is inseparably linked to nozzle diameter through 6.2.1, it is not possible to increase this value. What can be done is to increase the height of the coolant tubes. The inner surface of the nozzle contour will still be formed by circular coolant tube halves of radius $r_t$. But the height of the coolant tubes will be allowed in increase through the thickness of the nozzle wall, as shown on the rough sketch below.\n  img { display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; }   Figure 6.2.12:  Modified Coolant Tubes  In any spacecraft, adding structural weight comes at a high cost. Every effort must be made to minimize unnecessary mass. The modified coolant tubes are obviously larger, and weigh more than the original. Therefore the modified geometry will only be applied to the region with excessive pressure drop ($x \u0026lt; 0.85$ meters). The following plot shows how this re-design allows tube cross sectional area to remain constant near the nozzle attach flange.\n Figure 6.2.13:  Tube Cross-Sectional Area  This change in geometry does not have much of an effect on heat flux, but it does cause the maximum wall temperature to increase significantly. The effective stress in the re-designed tube has decreased, and the factor of safety is now greater than one along the entire length of the nozzle. The new design reduces exit velocity by 329 m/s, which in turn reduces pressure drop by 4 MPa. The following plots display these trends. Notice the changes only take place where the geometry has been modified (i.e. $x\u0026lt;0.85$ meters). As expected, the solutions are identical at all other locations.\nFigure 6.2.14:  Modified Tube Heat Flux  Figure 6.2.15:  Modified Tube Wall Temperatures  Figure 6.2.16:  Modified Tube Stresses  Figure 6.2.17:  Modified Tube Factor of Safety  Figure 6.2.18:  Coolant Pressure in Modified Tube  Figure 6.2.19:  Coolant Temperature in Modified Tube  Figure 6.2.20:  Coolant Velocity in Modified Tube  The following table compares the output from this model to data reported by Boeing.

For the most part, these topics were treated individually in their respective sections. The goal of this section is to examine the problem from a broader viewpoint and show how these models couple to form a comprehensive solution. The flow chart below describes the process.\nFigure 6.3.1: Computational Flow Diagram The combustion model developed in Section 3 is used to define the fluid properties at the injector face. The model established in Section 5.3 is then used to predict combustion gas properties as it flows down the LTMCC axis. For the initial iteration, the effects of heat transfer and friction are neglected. After the combustion gas properties through the LTMCC are known, the LTMCC heat transfer model (Section 6.1) is used to determine wall temperatures and heat flux. A second iteration of the flow model is then initiated, using the velocity and heat flux profiles developed in the first iteration as inputs. This allows the flow model to account for stagnation pressure drop due to viscosity and stagnation temperature drop due to heat transfer through the chamber walls. This process was looped until convergence was obtained. There was little appreciable change beyond the second iteration of this procedure, as shown below on Figure 6.3.2. This behavior is similar to that reported in Reference [69].\nFigure 6.3.2: Global convergence of LTMCC heat flux. First iteration in blue, second iteration in orange. Local convergence at each wall segment $dx$ in the heat transfer models took quite a bit more computational effort. Both the LTMCC and the nozzle were discretized into 200 segments, with the heat transfer calculations iterated over each segment until the residuals of Equations6.1.22 - 6.1.23, and Equations 6.2.6 -6.2.7 were less than 1 $W$. The minimum amount of heat transferred into any segment $dx$ in both the LTMCC and nozzle proper was 297 $W$. This corresponds to a maximum local error of 0.3%. The figure below plots the the number of local iterations required for convergence as a function of station number, $dx$. LTMCC stations run from 1-201, and nozzle stations run from 202-402.\nFigure 6.3.3: Iterations for Local Convergence The local iteration count appears to be sensitive to changes in geometry. The spikes in the LTMCC section align with changes in coolant passage dimensions (see Figure 6.1.2), and the large jump discontinuity in the nozzle proper corresponds to the re-designed coolant tubes (see Figure 6.2.13).\n Computational Framework  The following plots display global results from the both the compressible flow and heat transfer models with the effects of entropy included.\nFigure 6.3.4: Global Wall Temperature Profile Figure 6.3.5: Global Heat Flux Profile Figure 6.3.6: Global Static Pressure Profile Figure 6.3.7: Global Mach Number Profile Figure 6.3.8: Global Stagnation Temperature Profile Figure 6.3.9: Global Static Temperature Profile Properties at the nozzle exit plane are tabulated below for both the isentropic and non-isentropic solutions. As expected, nozzle performance degrades when accounting for the effects of friction and heat transfer. Both of these models tend to under predict thrust and specific impulse. This occurs because both models must be provided an injector face Mach number to initiate the calculation. In turn, this Mach number sets the mass flow rate through the system. Referring back to this discussion in Section 5.1, the mass flow rate through the engine is very sensitive to chamber stagnation pressure. If the reported stagnation pressure of 2871 psi is used, the Mach number required to initiate the compressible flow model corresponds to a mass flow rate of 520 kg/sec. This is approximately 6 percent too large, and would cause a corresponding 6 percent over-prediction in the amount of thrust generated. To impose the correct mass flow rate through the nozzle, chamber stagnation pressure was reduced to from 2871 psi to 2725 psi (isentropic case) and 2740 psi (with entropy). This allows the model to predict the correct mass flow rate, but causes the model to under-predict thrust and specific impulse. This adjustment accounts for the fact that the thermodynamic properties of the combustion gas flowing through the nozzle are functions of temperature and pressure. As shown above, these values vary widely between the injector face and nozzle exit plane. As these values change, so does the rate at which the chemical species in the exhaust gas dissociate and re-combine with each other. This means that due to these ongoing chemical reactions, the molecular weight and specific heat ratio of the combustion gas changes as a function of axial position within the nozzle. The model used on this website does not account for equilibrium effects like this. A \u0026ldquo;frozen flow\u0026rdquo; model is used instead that assumes exhaust composition is fixed at the injector face. Accounting for equilibrium effects would likely allow the model to run with both a chamber stagnation pressure 2871 psi and a mass flow rate of 492 kg/sec. Nevertheless, the results presented here are acceptable for a conservative preliminary design.\n.tg88 {border-collapse:collapse;border-spacing:0;margin-left:26%; margin-right:20%;}     Isentropic Model Non-Isentropic Model Actual Value    Mass Flow Rate $kg/sec$ 493 493  492[2]     Chamber Pressure, $psi$ 2725 2740  2871[2]     Exit Mach Number 4.577  4.534  4.540[66]    Exit Pressure, $Pa$ 20,250  20,044  -   Exit Temperature, $K$ 1176 1172  -    Thrust, $lbf$ 490,200  484,444  491,900[2]   Specific Impulse $[sec]$ 450.3  445.5  452[2]     Table 5.3.1  Previous   Top "},{"id":12,"href":"/combustion-model/3.1-chemistry/","title":"3.1 Chemistry","parent":"3.  Combustion Model","content":"  MathJax = { tex: {inlineMath: [['$', '$'], ['\\\\(', '\\\\)']]} };  Combustion Chemistry We are now in a position to use the thermodynamic properties calculated in the previous section to predict the chemical composition and flame temperature of the exhaust gas mixture produced in the SSME pre-burners and main combustion chamber. The model is based on a fuel-rich combustion process utilizing the following set of reactions, as described by Sozen.[37] The combustion processes begins with $x$ moles of diatomic hydrogen and $y$ moles of diatomic oxygen as reactants (Equation 3.1.a). But as the reaction continues, $H_2$, $O_2$, and $H_2O$ disassociate and recombine according to Equations 3.1.c -3.1.d. When the system reaches equilibrium, all six species in these equations will be present.\n\n(3.1.a) $$x\\,H_{2} + y\\,O_{2} \\rightleftharpoons \\left(2\\,y\\right)H_{2}O +\\left(x-2y\\right)H_2 $$ (3.1.b) $$H_{2} \\rightleftharpoons 2\\,H $$ (3.1.c) $$O_{2} \\rightleftharpoons 2\\,O $$ (3.1.d) $$ 2\\,H_{2}O \\rightleftharpoons H_2 +2\\,OH $$ In a perfectly stoichiometric reaction the coefficients $x$ and $y$ would be 2 and 1, respectively. If the reactants are mixed in exactly this ratio there will be no excess $H_2$ on the right-hand side of Equation 3.1.a. All of the reactants will be turned into the product, $H_2O$. This can be verified by noting that the $(x-2y)$ coefficient on the excess hydrogen term in Equation 3.1.a vanishes for $x = 2$ and $y = 1$.\nAgain, this model is designed to analyze a fuel-rich combustion process. Fuel-rich combustion contains excess hydrogen as product. The term \u0026ldquo;fuel-rich\u0026rdquo; refers to the reactant mixture ratio, $M$:\n(3.1.1) $$ M = \\frac{\\dot m_{O_2}}{\\dot m_{H_2}} $$ where $\\dot m$ is the propellant mass flow rate into the combustion chamber in kg/sec. To calculate the mixture ratio, we need to multiply the coefficients $x$ and $y$ by the molecular mass of diatomic hydrogen (2 g/mol) and diatomic oxygen (32 g/mol). It now becomes evident that:\n(3.1.2) $$ M = \\frac{\\dot m_{O_2}}{\\dot m_{H_2}} = \\frac{32\\,y}{2\\,x} $$ In the stoichiometric case, this equation reduces to:\n$$ M = \\frac{\\dot m_{O_2}}{\\dot m_{H_2}} = \\frac{32\\left(1\\right)}{2\\left(2\\right)} = 8 $$ This means that for fuel-rich combustion to occur, the mixture ratio must be less than 8. Plugging this value into Equation 3.1.2 and solving for $x$ reveals that in the case of fuel-rich combustion, $x \u0026gt; 2y$. This analysis ignores oxygen-rich combustion (mixture ratios greater than 8). As will be shown in following sections, for $H_2$ / $O_2$ combustion, specific impulse is maximized with a fuel-rich mixture ratio.[38]\nNow we will examine the relationships between Equations 3.1 a-d, starting with Equation 3.1.a as an example. The analysis begins by multiplying each term in Equation 3.1.a by a factor of \u0026ldquo;$a$\u0026rdquo; to distinguish it from the terms in Equations 3.1 b-d:\n(3.1.a) $$a\\,x\\,H_{2} + a\\,y\\,O_{2} \\implies a\\,\\left(2\\,y\\right)H_{2}O +a\\,\\left(x-2y\\right)H_2 $$ Next, we need to determine how the coefficients for each species change between the left and right sides of the equation. This is accomplished by subtracting the left-hand coefficient for each species from the corresponding right-hand coefficient. For $H_2$ in Equation 3.1.a the results are:\n$$ a\\,\\left(x-2\\,y\\right) -a\\,x =-2\\,a\\,y $$ For $O_2$:\n$$ 0-y\\,a=-y\\,a $$ Finally, for $H_2O$:\n$$ 2\\,y\\,a-0 = 2\\,y\\,a $$ These quantities represent the change in number of moles of each individual species between when reaction 3.1.a began and the final composition it reaches at equilibrium. Repeating this process for Equations 3.1 b-d gives the following changes in composition, $\\Delta_C$:\n.tg {border-collapse:collapse;border-spacing:0;margin:0px auto;} .tg td{border-color:black;border-style:solid;border-width:1px;font-family:Arial, sans-serif;font-size:14px; overflow:hidden;padding:10px 5px;word-break:normal;} .tg th{border-color:black;border-style:solid;border-width:1px;font-family:Arial, sans-serif;font-size:14px; font-weight:normal;overflow:hidden;padding:10px 5px;word-break:normal;} .tg .tg-c3ow{border-color:inherit;text-align:center;vertical-align:top} .tg .tg-7btt{border-color:inherit;font-weight:bold;text-align:center;vertical-align:top}    Equation $ H_2$ $ O_2$ $ H_2O$ $ OH$ $ O$ $ H$     3.1.a -2ya -ya 2ya 0 0 0   3.1.b -b 0 0 0 0 2b   3.1.c 0 -c 0 0 2c 0   3.1.d d 0 -2d 2d 0 0   $\\sum\\Delta_C$ -2ya-b+d -ya-c 2ya-2d 2d 2c 2b    Table 3.1.1: Composition Changes, $\\Delta_C$ Now we examine the reaction modeled by Equations 3.1.a-d as a whole, rather than individually. Taking a summation of the $\\Delta_C$ values in each column of Table 3.1.1 reveals the total change in number of moles of each species for the overall reaction. This summation is tabulated in the bottom row of Table 3.1.1.\nWe assume the reaction began with $x$ moles of $H_2$ and $y$ moles of $O_2$ as reactants. When the reaction reaches chemical equilibrium, all six species listed in Table 3.1.1 will be present in some unknown quantity, $C_i$:\n(3.1.3) $$x\\,H_{2} + y\\,O_{2} \\implies C_1\\,H_{2}O +C_2\\,H_2 + C_3\\,O_2+C_4\\,OH+C_5\\,H+C_6\\,O $$ The challenge is now to determine the $C_i$ coefficients. The $\\sum\\Delta_C$ values in Table 3.1.1 provide an expression for how much the $C_i$ coefficients change from the start of the reaction all the way to its conclusion. The $C_i$ coefficients represent the final quantities of each species present at equilibrium. Therefore if we take the the quantity of each species present at the start of the reaction $\\left(N_i\\right)$ and add to it the expression for how the quantity changes, we will know the amount of each species present at equilibrium. This is expressed mathematically as follows:\n(3.1.4) $$C_i = N_i +\\sum\\Delta_{C_i} $$ In Equation 3.1.4, $N_{i}$ is equal to $x$ for $H_2$, $y$ for $O_2$, and 0 for all other species. This allows us to write an expression for the overall chemical equation:[39]\n\n(3.1.5) $$x\\,H_{2} + y\\,O_{2} \\implies \\left(2\\,y\\,a-2\\,d\\right)H_{2}O +\\left(x-2y\\,a-b+d\\right)H_2 + \\left(y-y\\,a-c\\right)O_2+2\\,d\\,OH+2\\,b\\,H+2\\,c\\,O $$ Equation 3.1.5 shows that combustion began with $(x+y)$ moles of reactants. The coefficients on the right-hand side of the equation represent the number of moles of each species the system comes to at equilibrium. Taking the sum of all the right-hand coefficients gives the total number of moles of products:\n\n(3.1.6) $$N_{prod} =\\sum\\,C_i =-ya+x+y+b+c+d $$ If we divide the right-hand coefficients by the summation in Equation 3.1.6 we obtain the mole fractions, $Z$, of each product in the resulting mixture.\n\n(3.1.7) $$Z_{O_2} =\\frac{y-ya-c}{-ya+x+y+b+c+d} $$ (3.1.8) $$Z_{H_2O} =\\frac{2ya-2d}{-ya+x+y+b+c+d} $$ (3.1.9) $$Z_{H_2} =\\frac{x-2ya-b+d}{-ya+x+y+b+c+d} $$ (3.1.10) $$Z_{OH} =\\frac{2d}{-ya+x+y+b+c+d} $$ (3.1.11) $$Z_{H} =\\frac{2b}{-ya+x+y+b+c+d} $$ (3.1.12) $$Z_{O} =\\frac{2c}{-ya+x+y+b+c+d} $$ The $C_i$ coefficients can be used to calculate the mass generation rate, $\\dot{N}_i$, of each product in terms of moles per second:\n\n(3.1.13) $$ \\dot{N}_i = \\frac{C_i}{x+y}\\left(\\dot{m}_{H_2}+\\dot{m}_{O_2}\\right) $$ The $ \\dot{m}$ terms in the above equation represent the mass flow rates of hydrogen and oxygen reactants being pumped in to the combustion chamber in units of moles per second.\nWe now have an overdetermined system of six non-linear equations that are functions of the four variables a, b, c, and d. To complicate matters even further, this system does not include any mechanism to account for how the mole fractions vary as a function of temperature or pressure. To overcome this hurdle we must introduce the idea of an equilibrium constant.\nEquilibrium Constants The equilibrium constant, K, is a quantity that describes a chemical reaction\u0026rsquo;s tendency to approach completion. The equilibrium constant can be defined in terms of either the partial pressures of the species in the gas $\\left(K_P\\right)$ or in terms of mole fractions $\\left(K_n\\right)$.[40] Generally speaking, if $K_n$ values are small (less than 0.0001) the final composition the gas reaches at equilibrium will contain mostly reactants (terms on the left hand side of Equations 3.1 a-d). If $K_n$ is large (greater than 1000), the reaction tends to favor the products. Between these two values a more balanced mixture of reactants and products will be present.[41]\nThe equilibrium constant varies as function of temperature. This means that a chemical reaction could tend to favor reactants at low temperatures while leaning more toward products at high temperatures. The challenge is to develop the equilibrium constant for each reaction listed in Equations 3.1 a-d and use this information to determine the combustion temperature of the overall reaction described by Equation 3.1.5.\nWe begin with a model for $K_P$:[17]\n(3.1.14) $$ K_P = \\text{exp}\\left(\\frac{-\\Delta G}{R_uT}\\right) $$ In the above equation, $G$ represents Gibbs free energy. It is a thermodynamic property of the gas related to the amount of energy available to drive chemical reactions. Fortunately this property does not require any models or curve fits beyond what has already discussed on this website. The functions for enthalpy and entropy established in Section 2.4 can be combined in order to calculate the Gibbs energy of an individual species:[17]\n(3.1.15) $$ G(T)= h(T)-T \\times S(T) $$ where $h(T)$ and $S(T)$ are modeled by Equations 2.4.2 and 2.4.3, respectively. $\\Delta G$ refers to the change in Gibbs in energy between the products and reactants of an entire chemical equation:\n(3.1.16) $$ \\Delta G= \\sum_{products} C_i \\times G_i -\\sum_{reactants} C_i \\times G_i$$ $C_i$ represents the stoichiometric coefficients of the chemical reaction in question. In the case of Equation 3.1.a this means $x=2$ and $y=1$.\nIn other words, Equations 3.1.15 and 3.1.16 can be used to find $K_p$ as a function of temperature for each reaction shown in Equations 3.1.a-d. Results are shown below in Figure 3.1.1.\nFigure 3.1.1 It is interesting to note that the equilibrium constant is positive for reaction 3.1.a and negative for reactions 3.1.b-3.1.d. The sign of the equilibrium constant reflects the reaction\u0026rsquo;s tendency to produce or absorb heat. Exothermic reactions produce heat and have positive equilibrium constants. Endothermic reactions absorb heat from the surroundings and have negative equilibrium constants.[42] In both cases, as temperature increases the absolute value of the equilibrium constants approach zero.\nNow we need to link $K_p$ to the mole fractions described by Equations 3.1.7 - 3.1.12. We begin by defining the equilibrium constant based on mole fraction, $K_n$, as follows:[40]\n(3.1.17) $$ K_n=\\frac{\\prod_{prod} Z_i^{C_i}}{\\prod_{react} Z_i^{C_i}} $$ In Equation 3.1.17, $C_i$ represents the stoichiometric coefficients of the chemical reaction in question (i.e. x =2 y =1). Using Equation 3.1.a as an example:\n$$ K_n = \\frac{Z_{H_2O}^2}{Z_{H_2}^2 Z_{O_2}} $$ We can now link $K_n$ and $K_p$ through the following relation:[40]\n(3.1.18) $$ K_P=K_n\\left[P^{\\sum_{prod}C_i-\\sum_{react}C_i}\\right] $$ In Equation 3.1.18, $C_i$ represents the not necessarily stoichiometric coefficients of the chemical reaction in question (i.e. leave the coefficients in terms of x and y) . $P$ represents the ratio of pressure in the rocket combustion chamber to atmospheric pressure. Using Equation 3.1.a as an example:\n$$ K_P=\\left[\\frac{Z_{H_2O}^2}{Z_{H_2}^2 Z_{O_2}}\\right]P^{-y} $$ Completing this process for each of Equations 3.1. a-d establishes the following system of 4 non-linear equations:\n\n(3.1.19) $$ 0=\\left[\\frac{Z_{H_2O}^2}{Z_{H_2}^2 Z_{O_2}}\\right]P^{-y}-K_{P,a} $$ (3.1.20) $$ 0=\\left[\\frac{Z_{H}^2}{Z_{H_2}}\\right]P-K_{P,b} $$ (3.1.21) $$ 0=\\left[\\frac{Z_{O}^2}{Z_{O_2}}\\right]P-K_{P,c} $$ (3.1.22) $$ 0=\\left[\\frac{Z_{H_2}Z_{OH}^2}{Z_{H_2O}^2}\\right]P-K_{P,d} $$ It is important to remember that the $K_P$ terms in the above equations are not identical to each other. A unique value of $K_P$ must be determined for each chemical reaction described by Equations 3.1 a-d. This can be accomplished through the use of Equations 3.1.14 through 3.1.16. Another key point is that the mole fractions listed above, $Z$, are functions of the the variables a, b, c, and d. $K_P$ is a function of temperature. Assuming a known combustion chamber pressure ratio (P) and a known mixture ratio (set by x and y), we now have a system of 4 non-linear equations as a function of 5 unknown variables. One more equation is required to close the system: the first law of thermodynamics.\nPrevious   Next   Top "},{"id":13,"href":"/combustion-model/3.2-first-law-of-thermodynamics/","title":"3.2 First Law of Thermodynamics","parent":"3.  Combustion Model","content":"  MathJax = { tex: {inlineMath: [['$', '$'], ['\\\\(', '\\\\)']]} };  First Law of Thermodynamics The analysis begins with a thermodynamic system (perhaps a rocket combustion chamber, turbine, or pump) as shown below in Figure 3.2.1.\nFigure 3.2.1 Fluid enters the system at Station 1 with an internal energy $u_1$, pressure $P_1$, temperature $T_1$, and density $\\rho_1$. It flows through the device, exiting at Station 2 with internal energy $u_2$, pressure $P_2$, temperature $T_2$, and density $\\rho_2$. Fluid enters at velocity $V_1$, and exits at velocity $V_2$. The mass flow rate through the device is represented by $\\dot{m} $. $A_1$ and $A_2$ are the cross-sectional areas of the inlet and outlet. $Z$ represents the heights of the inlet and outlet above a common reference plane. $\\dot{W}$ represents shaft work going into or out of the system. In the case of a pump, shaft work goes into the system in order to pressurize the fluid. In the case of a turbine, shaft work extracts energy out of the system. $\\dot{Q}$ represents heat transfer through the walls of the system.\nThe first law of thermodynamics says that the amount of energy entering this system must be equal to the amount of energy leaving the system. This is described mathematically as follows:[3]\n(3.2.1) $$ \\int_1^2 \\left[u+\\frac{P}{\\rho}+\\frac{V^2}{2}+gZ\\right]\\rho\\, V \\cdot \\hat{n}\\, dA = \\Delta Q +\\Delta W $$ The terms inside the integral represent the different types of energy flowing through the system. $u+\\frac{P}{\\rho}$ is defined as the enthalpy of the fluid, $h$ (refer to Section 2.1). $\\frac{V^2}{2}$ is the kinetic energy of the fluid, and $gZ$ is gravitational potential energy. Assuming fluid properties are constant over the cross section of both the inlet and outlet (but not necessarily constant between Stations 1 and 2), $\\rho V \\cdot \\hat{n} dA$ becomes the mass flow rate of fluid across the control surface, $\\dot m$. Assuming steady-state conditions, integrating between Stations 1 and 2 gives the following:\n(3.2.2) $$ \\left[\\left(h_2-h_1\\right) +\\frac{V_1^2-V_2^2}{2}+g\\left(Z_2-Z_1\\right)\\right]\\dot{m} = \\left(Q_2-Q_1\\right)+\\left(W_2-W_1\\right)$$ Equation 3.2.2 is a general result applicable to any steady-state thermodynamic system with one inlet and one outlet to satisfy conservation of mass. We will now make several assumptions to tailor this general result into a better model of a rocket combustion chamber. First, we assume that very little time elapses as the fluid travels from Station 1 to Station 2 and completes the combustion process. This means that the distance between Stations 1 and 2 is relatively small. We can therefore assume that the combustion process is complete before the fluid enters the converging section of the nozzle and begins to accelerate. This means that $V_1$ = $V_2$ and $A_1$ = $A_2$. We will also assume that the difference in height between the entrance and exit of the combustion chamber is negligible $\\left(Z_1 = Z_2\\right)$. There is no shaft work into or out of the combustion chamber, so both $W_1$ and $W_2$ are 0. For now, we assume there is no heat transfer into or out of the combustion chamber ($Q_1$ and $Q_2$ = 0). This reduces the equation to\n(3.2.3) $$ h_1=h_2$$ This simple equation gives a powerful result. The enthalpy of the fluid entering the combustion chamber ($h_1$) must be equal to the enthalpy of the fluid exiting the chamber after combustion is complete ($h_2$). It is important to remember that an exothermic chemical reaction takes place in the combustion chamber. This reaction releases additional heat that must be accounted for. Therefore in Equation 3.2.3 the $h_2$ term actually consists of two components, $h_2 \\left(T\\right)$ and $h_f$, where $h_f$ is the heat of formation due to the chemical reaction. This will be discussed in more detail below.\nLet\u0026rsquo;s begin by analyzing the enthalpy of the reactants entering the combustion chamber that initiate the overall chemical reaction: $H_2$ and $O_2$. The enthalpy $h_1$ is found by taking the sum of the enthalpies of the individual reactants:\n(3.2.4) $$h_1 = h_{H_2}+h_{O_2}\t$$ But from the discussion of enthalpy in Section 2.5, it is important to remember that enthalpy of a fluid is only meaningful as difference in energy between two states. We can define the overall magnitude of enthalpy arbitrarily, as long as it is referenced to standardized baseline (see Equation 2.5.12). This analysis uses a reference temperature of 298.15 K and reference pressure of 101325 Pa. In order to account for this, the enthalpy magnitudes entered into the above equation are really the difference in enthalpy between the reference state and the state in existence at the combustion chamber entrance with pressure P and temperature T:\n(3.2.5) $$h_1 = h_{H_2}+h_{O_2}= \\left[h_{H_2}\\left(T,P\\right)- h_{H_2}\\left(298.15,101325\\right)\\right] + \\left[h_{O_2}\\left(T,P\\right)- h_{O_2}\\left(298.15,101325\\right)\\right] $$ In Section 2.5, a great deal of effort was spent showing that the enthalpy of an ideal gas does not  depend on pressure. Then why does pressure show up as a term in Equation 3.2.5? This occurs because the propellants entering the combustion chamber may be in either a liquid or gaseous state. The enthalpy of liquid propellants requires a “real” equation of state (such as the Helmholtz correlations in Sections 2.2 and 2.3) to account for the effects of pressure and intermolecular forces. The enthalpy of gaseous reactants can be modeled with the “ideal” correlations described in Section 2.4 that are independent of pressure.\nBoth the ideal and \u0026ldquo;real\u0026rdquo; enthalpy correlations used in this model are built in such a way that for the “reference elements” $H_2$ and $O_2$, enthalpy is defined to be zero at the reference temperature of 298.15 K and 101325 Pa (1 atmosphere). This allows Equation 3.2.5 to be simplified even further by eliminating the reference terms (298.15, 101325) where enthalpy is defined to be zero:\n(3.2.6) $$h_1 = h_{H_2}+h_{O_2}=h_{H_2}\\left(T,P\\right) + h_{O_2}\\left(T,P\\right) $$Now we shift our attention to the right-hand side of Equation 3.1.5 and focus on the species produced as a result of combustion. The overall enthalpy of the combustion products, $h_2$, is the summation of the enthalpies of the individual species in the resulting gaseous mixture. We begin by analyzing $H_2O$ in manner similar to $H_2$ and $O_2$. The enthalpy magnitude of $H_2O$ is again the difference between its enthalpy at temperature T and the reference temperature, 298.15 K. Since we are now dealing solely with gaseous species, we can utilize the ideal gas enthalpy model and ignore any effects of pressure. This reduces the equation to:\n(3.2.7) $$h_{H_2O} =h_{H_2O}\\left(T\\right)- h_{H_2O} \\left(298.15\\right) $$An important distinction to be aware of is that $H_2O$ is not one of the “reference elements”[16] used by the ideal gas enthalpy model of Section 2.4. This means that the magnitude of $h_{H_2O}\\left(298.15\\right)$ returned by Equation 2.4.2 is non-zero. It is important to be aware of this convention when dealing with elements that are not \u0026ldquo;reference elements\u0026rdquo; whose enthalpies are defined to be zero at 298.15 K. Therefore the $h_{H_2O}(298.15)$ term cannot be neglected as in the case of the reference elements $H_2$ and $O_2$.\nThis is not an entirely complete description of the enthalpy of this combustion product. The reaction between diatomic hydrogen and oxygen releases heat as these molecules recombine to form water vapor. An additional term must be added to account for the additional heat produced during the reaction. This term is called the “heat of formation,” $h_f$. Heat of formation for a chemical compound is calculated as follows:[17]\n(3.2.8) $$ h_f = \\sum c_i\\,h_i $$$c_i$ represents the stoichiometric coefficients of the chemical reaction needed to produce one mole of the compound of interest  using the standard reference elements $H_2$ and $O_2$ as reactants. The $c_i$ coefficients are positive for products and negative for reactants. As an example, consider the expression for the formation of $H_2O$ from the reference elements $H_2$ and $O2$:\n$$ \\frac{1}{2}\\,O_2+H_2 \\implies \\, H_2O $$Equation 3.2.8 can be utilized to calculate water’s heat of formation as a function of temperature. Again, the coefficients $c_i$ are negative for reactants and positive for products. This leaves us with the following equation:\n\n(3.2.9) $$ h_{f,H_2O} = h_{H_2O}\\left(T\\right)-\\frac{1}{2}h_{O_2}\\left(T\\right)-h_{H_2}\\left(T\\right) $$ Similar expressions can be developed for each species in the chemical model. It should be noted that as a consequence of Equation 3.2.8 the heat of formation for the reference elements $H_2$ and $O_2$ is zero at all temperatures. Therefore the heat of formation for these reference elements will be neglected in the following analysis.\nNow we return to where we left off on our discussion of the first law of thermodynamics. Referring to back to Equation 3.2.3, we were searching for $h_2$, the enthalpy of the gaseous mixture exiting the combustion chamber. All the necessary tools are now in place. The enthalpy $h_2$ consists of two terms. The first term models the enthalpy of the gas as a function of temperature, $h\\left(T\\right)-h\\left(298\\right)$, as shown in Equation 3.2.7. The second term accounts for the heat of formation, as shown in Equation 3.2.8. This provides an expression for $h_{2,i}$ of an individual species:\n(3.2.10) $$ h_{2,i}=h_{f,i}\\left(T\\right) +h_i\\left(T\\right)-h_i\\left(298.15\\right) $$ To obtain the total enthalpy of the fluid exiting the combustion chamber, Equation 3.2.10 must be applied to each of the six species present on the right-hand side of of Equation 3.1.5 (the total chemical reaction). This is represented by the following summation:\n(3.2.11) $$ h_2= \\sum_{i=1}^6 h_{2,i} $$ Now the expressions for $h_1$ and $h_2$ can be plugged in to the simplified version of the First Law, Equation 3.2.3, to reach the following conclusion:\n(3.2.12) $$ 0 = h_{H_2}\\left(T,P\\right) + h_{O_2}\\left(T,P\\right) - \\sum_{i=1}^6 h_{2,i} $$ Only one step remains! Equation 3.2.12 gives enthalpy in terms of $\\frac{J}{mol}$. We want to know how much power this corresponds to in terms of watts. We accomplish this by multiplying the each term in Equation 3.2.12 by its respective mass flow rate $\\dot{N}_i$, in terms of $\\frac{mol}{sec}$. Equation 3.1.13 contains an expression for $\\dot{N}_i$.\n\n(3.2.13) $$ 0 = \\dot{N}_{H_2}\\left[h_{H_2}\\left(T,P\\right)\\right] + \\dot{N}_{O_2}\\left[h_{O_2}\\left(T,P\\right)\\right] - \\sum_{i=1}^6 h_{2,i}\\,\\dot{N} _i $$ This is an excting result! Analyzing Equation 3.2.13 in conjunction with Equations 3.1.19 - 3.1.22  provides a closed system of five non-linear equations that are functions of the five variables a, b, c, d, and T. This system can be solved to determine the resulting equilibrium mole fractions and flame temperature for a given combustion chamber pressure, mixture ratio, and reactant input conditions.

Combustion Model","content":"  MathJax = { tex: {inlineMath: [['$', '$'], ['\\\\(', '\\\\)']]} };  Solution Procedure The preceding sections utilized equilibrium constants and the first law of thermodynamics to construct a set of five simultaneous non-linear equations to model combustion of hydrogen and oxygen. The full set of equations are reproduced here. For convenience, these functions are labeled $f_1$ through $f_5$:[37],[39] \n(3.1.19) $$ f_1:\\,\\,\\,\\, 0=\\left[\\frac{Z_{H_2O}^2}{Z_{H_2}^2 Z_{O_2}}\\right]P^{-y}-K_{P,a} $$ (3.1.20) $$ f_2:\\,\\,\\,\\, 0=\\left[\\frac{Z_{H}^2}{Z_{H_2}}\\right]P-K_{P,b} $$ (3.1.21) $$ f_3:\\,\\,\\,\\, 0=\\left[\\frac{Z_{O}^2}{Z_{O_2}}\\right]P-K_{P,c} $$ (3.1.22) $$ f_4:\\,\\,\\,\\, 0=\\left[\\frac{Z_{H_2}Z_{OH}^2}{Z_{H_2O}^2}\\right]P-K_{P,d} $$ (3.2.13) $$ f_5:\\,\\,\\,\\, 0 = \\dot{N}_{H_2}\\left[h_{H_2}\\left(T,P\\right)\\right] + \\dot{N}_{O_2}\\left[h_{O_2}\\left(T,P\\right)\\right] - \\sum_{i=1}^6 h_{2,i}\\,\\dot{N} _i $$ This system can be solved using a Newton-Raphson method analogous to the scheme described in Section 2.2.[15]  To initiate the algorithm, an initial guess must be provided for the value of each of the unknown variables. These initial guesses will be stored in the vector $A_i$:\n$$ A_i = \\left[\\begin{matrix} a_i \\\\ b_i\\\\c_i\\\\d_i\\\\T_i\\end{matrix}\\right]$$\nNext, Equations $f_1$ through $f_5$ must be differentiated with respect to the five unknown variables of interest: a,b,c,d, and T. Therefore there are $5 \\times 5= 25 $ partial derivatives, $F^\\prime$ to calculate:\n$$ F^\\prime = \\left[\\begin{matrix} \\frac{\\partial f_1}{\\partial a} \u0026amp; \\frac{\\partial f_1}{\\partial b} \u0026amp; \\frac{\\partial f_1}{\\partial c} \u0026amp; \\frac{\\partial f_1}{\\partial d} \u0026amp; \\frac{\\partial f_1}{\\partial T} \\\\ \\frac{\\partial f_2}{\\partial a} \u0026amp; \\frac{\\partial f_2}{\\partial b} \u0026amp; \\frac{\\partial f_2}{\\partial c} \u0026amp; \\frac{\\partial f_2}{\\partial d} \u0026amp; \\frac{\\partial f_2}{\\partial T} \\\\\\frac{\\partial f_3}{\\partial a} \u0026amp; \\frac{\\partial f_3}{\\partial b} \u0026amp; \\frac{\\partial f_3}{\\partial c} \u0026amp; \\frac{\\partial f_3}{\\partial d} \u0026amp; \\frac{\\partial f_3}{\\partial T} \\\\\\frac{\\partial f_4}{\\partial a} \u0026amp; \\frac{\\partial f_4}{\\partial b} \u0026amp; \\frac{\\partial f_4}{\\partial c} \u0026amp; \\frac{\\partial f_4}{\\partial d} \u0026amp; \\frac{\\partial f_4}{\\partial T} \\\\\\frac{\\partial f_5}{\\partial a} \u0026amp; \\frac{\\partial f_5}{\\partial b} \u0026amp; \\frac{\\partial f_5}{\\partial c} \u0026amp; \\frac{\\partial f_5}{\\partial d} \u0026amp; \\frac{\\partial f_5}{\\partial T}\\end{matrix}\\right]$$\nThese derivatives are evaluated numerically using a centered finite difference scheme and the values of $A_i$ guessed above. Here is an example:\n$$\\frac{\\partial f_1}{\\partial a}=\\frac{f_1\\left(a_i-\\Delta a,b_i,c_i,d_i,T_i\\right)+f_1\\left(a_i+\\Delta a,b_i,c_i,d_i,T_i\\right)}{2\\Delta a}$$\nAny convenient value can be used for $\\Delta a$, provided it is sufficiently small. The smaller $\\Delta a$ becomes, the more accurate the derivative will be. Theoretically, as $\\Delta a$ approaches zero, the derivative will contain no error.\nNext, each of the five equations is evaluated using the guess $A_i$ as an input. The results are stored in the vector $F$:\n$$ F = -1\\times\\left[\\begin{matrix} f_1\\left(A_i\\right) \\\\ f_2\\left(A_i\\right)\\\\f_3\\left(A_i\\right)\\\\f_4\\left(A_i\\right)\\\\f_5\\left(A_i\\right)\\end{matrix}\\right]$$\nThis reduces the original system of non-linear equations to a linear system:\n(3.3.1) $$ F^\\prime B = F $$ The matrix $B$ in the above equation is used to store intermediate values that will help reach the final answer. Equation 3.3.1 can be solved for $B$ using any standard technique for systems of linear equations like Gauss elimination with partial pivoting or LU decomposition.[15] Once $B$ is determined, it can be used to refine the initial guess for the solution of the system:\n$$ A_{i+1}=A_{i}+B = \\left[\\begin{matrix} a_{i+1} \\\\ b_{i+1}\\\\c_{i+1}\\\\d_{i+1}\\\\T_{i+1}\\end{matrix}\\right]$$\nAfter solving for the refined solution vector, the entire process is repeated using the new values from $A_{i+1}$ as the initial guess. This procedure is iterated until the solution vector $A$ converges to within a desired tolerance. One possible convergence criteria could be $\\text{abs}\\left(T_{i+1}-T_{i}\\right) \u0026lt; 1 $. This says that when the change in flame temperature between each iteration is less than 1 K, the algorithm has found a solution.\nOnce the solution converges, the values of $a$, $b$, $c$, and $d$ are plugged in to Equations 3.1.7 - 3.1.12 to solve for the mole fractions of each species in the exhaust mixture. We now have the composition of the combustion gas, along with its pressure and temperature. These results can plugged in the equations found in Sections 2.4 and 2.6 to solve for the relevant thermodynamic and transport properties.\nBenchmark Case In order to test the accuracy of the model, its output is compared against results from NASA\u0026rsquo;s Chemical Equilibrium with Applications (CEA) program.[43]  [85]  A benchmark case is established with the following input conditions:\n.tg55 {border-collapse:collapse;border-spacing:0;margin-left:30%; margin-right:25%;} .tg td{border-color:black;border-style:solid;border-width:1px;font-family:Arial, sans-serif;font-size:14px; overflow:hidden;padding:10px 5px;word-break:normal;} .tg th{border-color:black;border-style:solid;border-width:1px;font-family:Arial, sans-serif;font-size:14px; font-weight:normal;overflow:hidden;padding:10px 5px;word-break:normal;} .tg .tg-9wq8{border-color:inherit;text-align:center;vertical-align:middle} .tg .tg-uzvj{border-color:inherit;font-weight:bold;text-align:center;vertical-align:middle}    Chamber Pressure: 200 atm   Mixture Ratio: 6   Oxidizer: $O_2$ at 1 atm, 90 K   Fuel: $H_2$ at 1 atm, 20 K    Table 3.3.1 As shown in the following plots, the flame temperature and equilibrium mole fractions converge to their final result within 4 iterations.\nFigure 3.3.1 Converging Flame Temperature Figure 3.3.2 Converging Mole Fractions The output of this program is in excellent agreement with the results from NASA CEA. The thermodynamic properties have a relative error of less than 2%. A significant amount of error does exist on some of the predicted mole fractions (up to 97% error for $O$). This error is not particularly concerning though. When the chemical reaction reaches equilibrium at 3625 K, the population of $O$ molecules has been almost completely consumed. For all practical purposes, $Z_{O}=0.$ CEA predicts a mole fraction of 0.00205, while this model predicts 0.00407. The large amount of relative error between these near-zero mole fractions has little impact on the thermodynamic and transport properties. Relative error for species with significant mole fractions like $H_2O$ and $H_2$ is much better, 2.62% and 1.71% respectively.

Combustion Model","content":"  MathJax = { tex: {inlineMath: [['$', '$'], ['\\\\(', '\\\\)']]} };  Mixture Ratio Optimization The combustion model developed in the previous sections allows us to examine how the properties of the SSME exhaust vary as a function of reactant mixture ratio. In turn, these trends provide clues that assist in selecting the optimal mixture ratio to maximize engine performance. We will begin by examining flame temperature. As shown below in Figure 3.4.1, flame temperature reaches its maximum value when $O_2$ and $H_2$ are combined at the stoichiometric mixture ratio of 8:1.\nFigure 3.4.1 A rocket engine produces thrust by converting the thermal energy of the combustion products into kinetic energy as the exhaust accelerates through the nozzle. Based on this principle, it seems logical to select the stoichiometric mixture ratio to maximize the amount heat available to make this conversion. But rocket engine performance is not governed by combustion temperature alone. Exhaust gas composition plays a significant role. Exhaust composition as a function of mixture ratio is plotted below in Figures 3.4.2 and 3.4.3.\nFigure 3.4.2 Figure 3.4.3 The stoichiometric $O_2/H_2$ reactant mixture ratio creates an exhaust gas consisting of approximately 70% water vaper, 13% diatomic hydrogen, and 17% other species by mole fraction. As the mixture ratio decreases from 8, the water vapor mole fraction decreases and the diatomic hydrogen mole fraction increases. The combustion model does not perform particularly well at predicting mole fractions for $OH$ and $H$ at mixtures ratios of less than four. Again, this error is not particularly concerning since these mole factions are very small have little impact on the overall thermodynamic properties of the exhaust gas mixture.\nOn the other hand, the large mole fraction of $H_2O$ makes a significant impact on the exhaust properties. At a mixture ratio of 8 the exhaust gas is mostly water vaper and the molecular weight approaches that of water, 18 grams per mole. As the mixture ratio decreases, diatomic hydrogen becomes the predominant species and the molecular weight approaches that of $H_2$, two grams per mole. This trend is plotted below on Figure 3.4.4.\nFigure 3.4.4 An important thermodynamic property that is directly affected by gas composition is the specific heat ratio, $\\gamma$. This quantity reflects the ability of a gas molecule to store energy. Small values of $\\gamma$ correspond to high energy storage capacity.[38]  The specific heat ratio is minimized at the stoichiometric mixture ratio of 8, as shown below.\nFigure 3.4.5 We are now positioned to use both molecular weight and the specific heat ratio to analyze the performance of the combustion process. This is accomplished by calculating the \u0026ldquo;characteristic velocity\u0026rdquo; produced by the combustion chamber, c* (pronounced cee-star):[38] \n\n(3.4.1) $$ c^* = \\frac{\\sqrt{\\gamma\\,R_s\\,T}}{\\gamma\\,\\sqrt{\\left[\\frac{2}{\\gamma+1}\\right]^{\\frac{\\gamma+1}{\\gamma-1}}}} $$ The following plot displays c* as a function of mixture ratio.\nFigure 3.4.6 Figure 3.4.6 illustrates a surprising result. Characteristic velocity (i.e. combustion performance) is maximized at a mixture ratio of approximately 3.5 rather than a mixture ratio of 8 as initially suggested by Figures 3.4.1 and 3.4.5. There are two competing factors at play here: the energy of the combustion gas (controlled by flame temperature and specific heat ratio) and the molecular weight of the gas. Take a look at Equation 3.4.1. $c^*$ will be maximized when flame temperature is at its maximum (mixture ratio of 8), specific heat ratio is at its minimum (mixture ratio of 8), and the specific gas constant, $R_s$, is at its maximum. Remember that $R_s=R_u/M$, where $M$ is molecular weight. Therefore $R_s$ is maximized when molecular weight is minimized. This occurs at low mixture ratios, as shown in Figure 3.4.4. Optimal combustion performance occurs at a mixture ratio of approximately 3.5 that balances low molecular weight with a high flame temperature and a low specific heat ratio.\nCombustion performance is important, but it does not quite tell the whole story. Nozzle performance must be taken into account as well. This is accomplished by calculating the engine thrust coefficient, $C_f$:[38] \n(3.4.2) $$ C_f= \\sqrt{\\frac{2\\gamma^2}{\\gamma-1}\\left[\\frac{2}{\\gamma+1}\\right]^{\\frac{\\gamma+1}{\\gamma-1}}\\left[1-\\left(\\frac{p_e}{p_c}\\right)^{\\frac{\\gamma-1}{\\gamma}}\\right]}+\\epsilon\\left[\\frac{p_e-p_a}{p_c}\\right] $$ In Equation 3.4.2, $\\epsilon$ represents the nozzle expansion ratio (i.e. the cross-sectional area of the nozzle exit divided by the cross-sectional area of the nozzle throat). $p_e$ represents the pressure of the exhaust gas at when it reaches the nozzle exit. $p_c$ is the pressure in the combustion chamber, and $p_a$ is the ambient pressure the nozzle is exhausting into.\nThe $p_e-p_a$ term in Equation 3.4.2 shows that high ambient pressures reduce rocket performance. Performance would be maximized operating in vacuum where $p_a$ is zero. The $1-p_e/p_c$ term shows that nozzle performance is maximized when exit pressure is minimized. An ideal rocket nozzle would operate in vacuum and expand the exhaust to an exit pressure of zero. Exit pressure is controlled by the expansion ratio, $\\epsilon$. In order to reach an exit pressure of zero, an infinite expansion ratio is required (i.e. a massive rocket nozzle with a huge exit diameter). This is clearly not practical. The the Space Shuttle RS-25 Block IIA engines use an expansion ratio of 69[44] , which results in an exit pressure of approximately 20,000 Pa. This is a very small, but non-zero pressure. Combustion chamber pressure, $p_c$ in this engine is approximately 2.026*10^7 Pa (200 atm). Using this data, we can plot $C_f$ as a function of mixture ratio for both an ideal rocket nozzle (infinite expansion ratio) and the SSME with a fixed expansion ratio of 69.\nFigure 3.4.7 For both the ideal expansion and the fixed expansion, thrust coefficient is maximized at a mixture ratio of 8. This leaves us with a problem. What is the optimal mixture ratio? We could maximize nozzle performance (modeled by $C_f$) if we select a mixture ratio of 8. We could maximize combustion performance (modeled by $c^*$) by selecting a mixture ratio of 3.5. In order to resolve this contridiction, we must introduce another concept: specific impulse.\nSpecific Impulse Impulse is a quantity that describes both the magnitude and duration that a force, $F$, acts upon an object. Mathematically, impulse, $I$, is described as follows:[45] \n(3.4.3) $$ I = \\int_{t_1}^{t_2} F\\left(t\\right)dt $$ In the case of a rocket engine, the force of interest is the thrust generated by the engine. Let\u0026rsquo;s assume we are testing a miniature rocket engine that produces a constant thrust of 100 N for a duration of 5 seconds, as plotted below.\nFigure 3.4.8 The amount of impulse produced during this test can be calculated utilizing Equation 3.4.3. The integral in this equation represents the area underneath the curve plotted above, which in this case is 500 $N\\cdot s$.\nSince this is a steady state test, the propellent mass flow rate, $\\dot m$, through the engine is constant. Let\u0026rsquo;s assume that that $\\dot m =$ 5 kg/s, as plotted below.\nFigure 3.4.9 Specific impulse, $I_{sp}$, is defined as the total impulse, $I$, divided by the weight of propellent expended. Weight is equal to mass, m, multiplied by the acceleration of gravity, g.\n(3.4.4) $$ I_{sp} = \\frac{I}{mg} $$ The mass of propellant expended is equal to the area underneath the curve in Figure 3.4.9. This is described mathematically as follows:\n(3.4.5) $$ m = \\int_{t_1}^{t_2} \\dot m\\left(t\\right)dt $$ In this example the area described by this integral (m) is equal to $ 5$ $kg/s \\cdot 5 s = 25$ $kg$.\nUtilizing Equation 3.4.4, specific impulse can then be described as:\n(3.4.6) $$ I_{sp} = \\frac{\\int_{t_1}^{t_2} F\\left(t\\right)dt}{g\\int_{t_1}^{t_2} \\dot m\\left(t\\right)dt} $$ In this example,\n$$ I_{sp} = \\frac{500\\,Ns}{25\\,kg \\cdot9.81\\,m/s^2} = 2.04\\,s $$ Looking back at Equation 3.4.6, it becomes evident that specific impulse is the ratio of thrust generated to mass of propellant expended. A highly efficient rocket engine would generate a large amount of thrust while expending very little propellant. This is the factor we will use to select the optimal mixture ratio for driving the combustion process described in the preceding sections.\nThe combustion model described in the previous sections is independent of nozzle design. This model only solves for combustion gas properties and does not reveal any information regarding how much thrust, $F\\left(t\\right)$, the rocket engine generates. The model is also independent of mass flow rate $\\dot m\\left(t\\right)$. These are two key terms required for calculating specific impulse with Equation 3.4.6. So how can we proceed when we lack these two critical pieces of information? Fortunately $I_{sp}$ can be calculated by an alternative method utilizing data already obtained with Equations 3.4.1 and 3.4.2:[38] \n(3.4.7) $$ I_{sp} = \\frac{c^*C_f}{g} $$ Figure 3.4.10 The curves plotted above show how specific impulse varies as a function of mixture ratio. These plots were generated under the assumption that the engine is operating in vacuum conditions. The orange curve corresponds to an \u0026ldquo;ideal\u0026rdquo; expansion (i.e. infinitely large nozzle). The blue curve corresponds to real performance of the SSME utilizing an expansion ratio 69. This chart illustrates an interesting concept. The \u0026ldquo;ideal\u0026rdquo; expansion plotted above was calculated without any reference to the physical design of the engine. It shows that that chemical rocket engine performance is limited not by turbomachinery or nozzle design, but instead by the energy storage capacity and molecular weight of the propellants.[46]  A rocket engine powered by liquid hydrogen and liquid oxygen is not capable of producing more than approximately 549 seconds of specific impulse.\nThis concept can be proven by examining the amount of energy stored within the chemical bonds of a water molecule. Let\u0026rsquo;s return our attention to the first equation introduced on the homepage of the website:\n(1) $$ 2H_{2} + O_{2} \\implies 2H_{2}O $$ This is the fundamental reaction powering the SSME. Hydrogen and oxygen are combined to form water. Utilizing Equation 3.2.9 we can calculate the heat of formation for $H_2O$ when it is produced in the SSME main combustion chamber at a temperature of 3600 K. Performing this calculation reveals that $h_{f,H_2O}$ is 252 kJ/mol.\nNow imagine this mole of water is accelerated through an \u0026ldquo;ideal\u0026rdquo; rocket engine with an infinite expansion ratio. It gains velocity and converts all 252,000 J of its chemical potential energy into kinetic energy. The kinetic energy of a particle is equal to $\\frac{1}{2}mv^2$. Using this equation and the molecular weight of water (18 g/mol), the velocity, $v$, of the mole of water can be predicted when it exits the rocket engine:\n$$ \\frac{1}{2}\\left(0.018\\right)\\,v^2=252000 $$ Solving this equation for $v$ reveals that the mole of water has been accelerated to a velocity of 5291.5 m/s.\nThe amount of thrust, $F$, produced by a chemical rocket engine operating in vacuum is equal to the mass flow rate of propellant travelling through the nozzle multiplied by its exit velocity:[46] \n$$ F=v\\,\\dot m $$ We now have enough information to utilize Equation 3.4.6 and calculate the specific impulse of this \u0026ldquo;ideal\u0026rdquo; $H_2/O_2$ rocket engine:\n$$ I_{sp} = \\frac{\\int_{t_1}^{t_2} v\\,\\dot m\\left(t\\right) \\,dt}{g\\int_{t_1}^{t_2} \\dot m\\left(t\\right)dt} $$ Assuming steady conditions this reduces to:\n$$ I_{sp} = \\frac{ v\\,\\dot m \\left(t_2-t_1\\right)}{g\\, \\dot m\\left(t_2-t_1\\right)} = \\frac{v}{g}=\\frac{5291.5}{9.81} = 539\\,s$$ This value is within 2% of the maximum specific impulse predicted by the combustion model in Figure 3.4.10. This figure indicates that optimum mixture ratio for our \u0026ldquo;ideal\u0026rdquo; $H_2/O_2$ engine is 4.5, and the optimum mixture ratio for the \u0026ldquo;real\u0026rdquo; engine is 4.0. This is close to the right answer, but there is one final factor to consider: the volume of the tanks required to store the propellants.\nTank Volume Optimization We need several additional pieces of data to calculate the required propellant storage capacity. During lift-off it is assumed all three of the SSMEs are operating at 104.5% of their rated power level and each producing 491,000 pounds of thrust. The engines will fire continuously for 520 seconds before main engine cutoff.[2]  The hydrogen and oxygen stored in the external tank have densities of 70 $kg/m^3$ and 1141 $kg/m^3$ respectively, as tabulated in Sections 1.1 and 1.2. Note that liquid hydrogen is 16 times less dense than liquid oxygen. This massive disparity in density will drive the tank volume optimization.\nUsing this data we can calculate the total mass of propellant needed during lift-off. The total impulse, $I$, generated during launch is calculated using Equation 3.4.3. In this there are 3 engines each producing 491,000 pounds of thrust for 520 seconds. After calculating the total impulse generated during launch, Equation 3.4.4 can be re-arranged to solve for the total mass of propellant expended:\n(3.4.8) $$ m_{tot}=\\frac{I}{I_{sp}} $$ The total impulse, $I$ required for launch is a fixed value. Specific impulse, $I_{sp}$, is a function of mixture ratio, as previously shown. Therefore we can use Equation 3.4.8 and calculate the total propellant mass $m_{tot}$ and a function mixture ratio, $MR$. Knowing the mixture ratio allows $m_{tot}$ to be split into its hydrogen and oxygen components:\n(3.4.9) $$ m_{H_2}=\\frac{m_{tot}}{1+MR} $$ (3.4.10) $$ m_{O_2}=\\frac{m_{tot}}{\\frac{1}{MR}+1} $$ These individual masses can then be multiplied by propellant density to calculate the required volume for each storage tank. The mass and storage requirements are plotted below in Figures 3.4.11 and 3.4.12.\nFigure 3.4.11  Figure 3.4.12 Figure 3.4.11 shows that total propellant mass is minimized at a mixture ratio of 4. This agrees with Figure 3.4.10 which shows that specific impulse is maximized at a mixture ratio of 4. Figure 3.4.12 shows that hydrogen storage tank volume is very sensitive to mixture ratio. Increasing the mixture ratio from 4 to 6 results in an overall tank volume reduction of 13% while only increasing the required mass of propellant by 3.5%. This increase in propellent mass can be offset by savings in the structural mass of the storage tank. Shifting the mixture ratio from 4 to 6 allows for construction of a small and lighter storage tank and may eliminate drag penalties as well.\nAfter examining many factors NASA finally came to to chose 6 the final answer for the \u0026ldquo;optimum\u0026rdquo; mixture ratio for the SSME. The model developed here predicts that at a mixture ratio of 6.0 the engine will operate with a specific impulse of 458 seconds, as shown in Figure 3.4.10. The actual SSME produces a specific impulse of 452 seconds, which differs from this model\u0026rsquo;s prediction by only 1.3%. This result will be further refined in Section 4.5.\nPrevious   Next   Top "},{"id":16,"href":"/equation-of-state/2.1-background/","title":"2.1 Background","parent":"2.  Equations of State","content":"  MathJax = { tex: {inlineMath: [['$', '$'], ['\\\\(', '\\\\)']]} };  Equations of State The previous section tracked the enthalpy of the propellants as they flowed through the components of the engine. But what exactly is enthalpy? And what does it have to do with an equation of state? Enthalpy is not as intuitive to understand as the pressure and temperature of a fluid. Mathematically, enthalpy is defined as follows:\n(2.1.1) $ h=u+\\frac{P}{\\rho} $ $ h= $ enthalpy $($J/kg$)$ $ u= $ internal energy $($J/kg$)$ $ P= $ pressure $($Pa$)$ $ \\rho= $ density $($kg/m3$)$ As shown by Equation 2.1.1, the enthalpy of a fluid is the sum of the fluid’s internal energy (due to intermolecular forces and temperature) and its flow energy (due to density and pressure).[3]   It is mathematically convenient to combine both internal energy and flow energy into one property known as enthalpy. Knowing the enthalpy of the propellants as they flow through rocket engine aids greatly in estimating the amount of power required to drive the engine’s turbomachinery (see Section 4). But how can the enthalpy of a propellant be estimated? Pressure is measured easily enough by mounting a transducer on a pipeline, but it is not so easy to measure internal energy due to intermolecular forces. An equation of state must be used to help solve this problem. An equation of state relates the temperature, pressure, and density of a fluid  [4].  . Perhaps the most well-known equation of state is the ideal gas law:\n(2.1.2) $ P=\\rho\\,R_s\\,T $ $ R_s=$ specific gas constant $ T= $ temperature $($K$)$ The following example illustrates the link between enthalpy and the equation of state.\n Example 2.1 Consider liquid hydrogen flowing through a pipeline at a constant pressure of 1 atmosphere at an initial temperature of 20 K. After travelling a short distance it flows through a check valve, and on the other side of the valve the temperature has increased to 21 K while the pressure remains 1 atmosphere. How has this small temperature change affected the enthalpy of the flow?\nThe first item to bear in mind is that it may not be possible to use the ideal gas equation to predict the initial density of the flow, since it began as a liquid (where intermolecular forces cannot be neglected). Secondly, even though the temperature change across the check valve was only 1 K, this small change drastically altered the fluid. In fact, the hydrogen has now boiled and is no longer a liquid, but a vapor. Figures 2.1.1 and 2.1.2 plot the density and enthalpy of the hydrogen on each side of the valve. Note how the small temperature change caused the density to decrease by a factor of 50. The ideal gas equation of state is not necessarily capable of modeling phase changes like this. \nFigure 2.1.1  Figure 2.1.2\n How are phase changes modeled? A traditional fluid phase diagram splits the pressure-temperature plane into four quadrants separated by the critical isobar $ P_c $ and critical isotherm $T_c$  [5]   as shown below below in Figure 2.1.3. The intersection of the critical isobar and critical isotherm is known as the critical point. This is the location where liquid and vapor states become indistinguishable from each other.  [4]   The blue line shown on Figure 2.1.3 represents the saturation curve. Along this line, the fluid is boiling and the distinct liquid and vapor states in regions $I_L$ and $ I_V $ exist together in equilibrium. Discontinuities in the density and enthalpy fields arise when crossing this line (as shown above in Figures 2.1.1 and 2.1.2).\n\n\nFigure 2.1.3  [6]   Depending on who you ask, each quadrant on the phase diagram corresponds to a different fluid state.  [5]   Some typical examples are listed here:\n.tg {border-collapse:collapse;border-spacing:0; margin-left:5%; margin-right:5%;} .tg td{border-color:black;border-style:solid;border-width:1px;font-family:Arial, sans-serif;font-size:14px; overflow:hidden;padding:10px 5px;word-break:normal;} .tg th{border-color:black;border-style:solid;border-width:1px;font-family:Arial, sans-serif;font-size:14px; font-weight:normal;overflow:hidden;padding:10px 5px;word-break:normal;} .tg .tg-18eh{border-color:#000000;font-weight:bold;text-align:center;vertical-align:middle} .tg .tg-xwyw{border-color:#000000;text-align:center;vertical-align:middle}     Engineering Toolbox [7]   National Institute of Standards and Technology [8]   Younglove, B.A. [9]       $I_L$  Liquid  Liquid  Liquid    $I_V$  Gaseous  Vapor  Fluid    $II$  Gaseous  Vapor  Fluid    $III$  Supercritical  Supercritical  Fluid    $IV$  Compressible Liquid  Liquid  Liquid     An equation of state that is more complex than the ideal gas law must be used to adequately model fluid properties in these different regions.\nThe Helmholtz Free Energy Equation of State Helmholtz energy is used to describe the amount work that can be extracted from a closed system at constant temperature and volume. [10] In a similar manner to the ideal gas equation, two properties (in this case density and temperature) must be specified to calculate the Helmholtz energy of a fluid:\n(2.1.3) $ a=a(\\rho, T) $ $a$ = Helmholtz energy $($J/kg$)$ Helmholtz energy is typically specified in reduced form:\n(2.1.4) $$\\alpha =\\frac{a(\\delta, \\tau)}{R_s} $$ $\\alpha$ = reduced Helmholtz energy $\\delta$ = reduced density (2.1.5) $$\\delta =\\frac{\\rho}{\\rho_c} $$ $\\tau$ = reduced reciprocal temperature (2.1.6) $$\\tau =\\frac{T_c}{T} $$ $T_c$ and $\\rho_c$ represent temperature and density at the critical point (refer to Figure 2.1.3).\nA unique characteristic of the Helmholtz free energy equation of state (as opposed to the ideal gas law) is that it can be split into two terms, one describing the ideal gas contribution, and the other describing the residual contribution due to intermolecular forces:[11]\n\n(2.1.7) $$\\alpha =\\alpha^0(\\tau, \\delta)+\\alpha^r(\\tau, \\delta) $$ $\\alpha^0$ = ideal gas compent of reduced Helmholtz energy $\\alpha^r$ = residual compent of reduced Helmholtz energy Over the years, researchers tabulated thousands of thermodynamic data points and developed sets of non-linear regressions to model $\\alpha^0$ and $\\alpha^r$ as functions of $\\tau$ and $\\delta$ .\nFinally: The Link Between Enthalpy and the Equation of State The Helmholtz free energy equation of state provides a single tool capable of determining fluid properties in all four quadrants of Figure 2.1.3. A reduced reciprocal temperature ($\\tau$) and a reduced density ($\\delta$) are plugged in to the non-linear regression model (Equation 2.1.7). All of the data required to use this equation for SSME propellants is tabulated in Sections 1.1 and 1.2. The regression model returns the ideal gas and residual contributions of the Helmholtz energy, $\\alpha^0$ and $\\alpha^r.$ Taking derivatives of these contributions with respect to $\\tau$ and $\\delta$ allows many different thermodynamic properties to be calculated, including enthalpy.[11] Sections 2.2 and 2.3 and present a qualitative description of the results applicable to hydrogen and oxygen, as well as mathematical details on how to perform the calculations.\nPrevious   Next   Top "},{"id":17,"href":"/equation-of-state/2.2-hydrogen-model/","title":"2.2 Hydrogen Model","parent":"2.  Equations of State","content":"  MathJax = { tex: {inlineMath: [['$', '$'], ['\\\\(', '\\\\)']]} };  Hydrogen Phase Diagram As shown in the previous section, the reduced Helmholtz equation of state can be broken into two components, one modeling ideal gas effects ($\\alpha^0$), and the other corresponding to the residual contribution from intermolecular forces ($\\alpha^r$). This equation of state allows for construction of a phase diagram that is more nuanced than the “four quadrant” model described in Section 2.1. The figures below present phase diagrams for hydrogen generated with the Helmholtz equation of state. \n\nFigure 2.2.1  Figure 2.2.2  The surface contour on these figures shows how the reduced density, $\\frac{\\rho }{\\rho_c}$, of hydrogen varies as a function of the reduced temperature, $\\frac{T}{T_c}$, and reduced pressure, $\\frac{P }{P_c}$. Properties identified with a subscript \u0026ldquo;c\u0026rdquo; represent the density, temperature, and pressure at the critical point:[11]\n$\\rho_c = \\text{31.112}\\ \\frac{\\text{kg}}{m^3} $ $T_c = \\text{32.938 K}$ $P_c = \\text{1.284 MPa}$ Along the saturation line a discontinuity in the density field is clearly visible. This makes physical sense, as the saturation line represents the locations where the hydrogen is undergoing a distinct phase change (boiling or condensing).\nAbove the critical point, the state of the fluid becomes less well defined. A “pseudo-boiling line”[5] is clearly visible in Figures 2.2.1 and 2.2.2. Along the this line where $\\frac{\\rho }{\\rho_c}$ is approximately 1.2 – 1.4 there is a definite transition between the liquid and gaseous states, but the transition happens linearly and the discontinuity in the density field begins to dissipate. This trend is visible in the isochores (lines of constant density) plotted above in Figures 2.2.1 and 2.2.2, and again in the plots along the sub-critical (red), near-critical (blue), and super-critical (green) isobars shown below in Figure 2.2.3. \nFigure 2.2.3  The model presented here contains some turbulence along the both the saturation curve and the pseudo-boiling line. Mathematical difficulties arise in performing property calculations in close to proximity to these lines. Details regarding this are discussed further below in the mathematics section. Some turbulence also exists in the upper left quadrant of the chart (the region with low temperatures and high pressures). This region is close to the hydrogen freezing/melting line. The Helmholtz equation of state is not designed to calculate the thermodynamic properties of solid hydrogen.\nThe figures above clearly show that the “quadrants” established by the traditional phase diagram (Figure 2.1.3) do not necessarily correspond to meaningful physical differences in the thermodynamic properties of the fluid. One good way to further visualize this is to introduce the concept of the compressibility factor, Z:\n(2.2.1) $$Z=\\frac{P}{\\rho\\, R\\,T} $$ This expression is simply a re-arranged form of the ideal gas law. It represents the ratio of the real fluid pressure (accounting for the intermolecular forces significant in liquids) to the pressure that would be exerted by an ideal gas at the same conditions. The ideal gas equation of state holds true when Z=1. Figure 2.2.4 plots the compressibility factor for hydrogen factor as a function of reduced temperature and pressure. \nFigure 2.2.4  The Z = 1 line is clearly visible. But there is also a significant region in the reduced P-T surface where the compressibility factor deviates less than 5 percent from the ideal value ( between Z = 0.95 and Z = 1.05). This trend indicates that for hydrogen, in the region where Tr \u0026gt;2.25 and Pr \u0026lt; 5, one can describe the fluid as either “supercritical” or an “ideal gas” with minimal contradiction[5].\nThe figure below plots the enthalpy of hydrogen across the reduced P-T plane. Notice how for higher temperatures enthalpy becomes a function of temperature alone (nearly independent of pressure). At low temperatures and pressures near the critical point enthalpy is not independent of pressure. \n Figure 2.2.5  Figure 2.2.6 plots the specific heat of hydrogen as function of reduced density and temperature. The points overlaid on top of this figure correspond to the turbomachinery stations described in Section 1.1 . This provides a visual representation of how the thermodynamic properties of hydrogen change is it flows through the SSME turbomachinery, all the way from the external storage tank to the pre-burner inlets. Figure 2.2.7 shows how specific heat peaks when transitioning over the saturation and pseudo-boiling lines.\n\nFigure 2.2.6  .tg1 {border-collapse:collapse;border-color:#ccc;border-spacing:0; margin-left:25%; margin-right:25%;} .tg1 td{background-color:#fff;border-color:#ccc;border-style:solid;border-width:1px;color:#333; font-family:Arial, sans-serif;font-size:14px;overflow:hidden;padding:10px 5px;word-break:normal;} .tg1 th{background-color:#f0f0f0;border-color:#ccc;border-style:solid;border-width:1px;color:#333; font-family:Arial, sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-weight:normal;overflow:hidden;padding:10px 5px;word-break:normal;} .tg1 .tg-c3ow{border-color:inherit;text-align:center;vertical-align:top} .tg1 .tg-7btt{border-color:inherit;font-weight:bold;text-align:center;vertical-align:top}    Station Component $\\frac{P}{P_c}$ $\\frac{T}{T_c}$     1 Low Pressure Fuel Turbopump Inlet 0.2 0.6   4 High Pressure Fuel Turbopump Exit 31.6 1.6   7 Nozzle Cooling Jacket Exit 28.7 10.2   9 Combustion Chamber Liner Exit 23.6 8.1   13 Fuel Pre-Burner H2 Inlet 28.2 4.6   14 Oxidizer Pre-Burner H2 Inlet 28.2 4.6    Table 2.2.1  Figure 2.2.7  Orthohydrogen and Parahydrogen   One additional factor that must be considered when analyzing the thermodynamic properties of hydrogen is the orientation of the molecule’s nuclear spin. A hydrogen molecule consists of two protons. Each proton has a quantized spin motion oriented perpendicular to the molecular axis. The nuclear spin of these two protons could be aligned with each other (parallel) or rotated 180 degrees apart (anti-parallel). Hydrogen with a parallel spin orientation is referred to as orthohydrogen. Hydrogen with an anti-parallel spin orientation is referred to as parahydrogen.[14]\nTo model these effects, hydrogen can be treated as a mixture of orthohydrogen and parahydrogen, the exact composition of which is temperature dependent. Above 300 K hydrogen contains 75% ortho molecules and 25% para molecules. This composition is commonly referred to as “normal” hydrogen.[11] At cold temperatures below the critical point the composition consists almost exclusively of para molecules. Figure 2.2.8 plots hydrogen composition as a function of temperature. \nFigure 2.2.8   Mathematical Details  Referring to back to Section 2.1, a reduced reciprocal temperature ($\\tau$) and a reduced density ($\\delta$) are plugged in to the Helmholtz model (Equation2.1.7). The model returns the ideal gas ($\\alpha^0$) and residual ($\\alpha^r$) contributions of the Helmholtz energy.

That state must be specified by a known temperature and density. This creates a problem. It is relatively straight forward to attach a thermocouple to a hydrogen pipeline and measure the fluid’s temperature. It is not so easy to measure the fluid’s density as it flows through that pipeline. It is much simpler to install a pressure transducer and then specify the hydrogen’s state using a measured temperature and measured pressure. Density would be calculated from the equation of state, rather than measured. Unfortunately the Helmholtz model requires density as an input. It predicts pressure as a function of temperature and density: $P=P\\left(\\rho, T\\right)$. It would be much more convenient to have an expression for density that is a function of pressure and temperature: $\\rho=\\rho\\left(P, T\\right)$.\nAn implicit Newton-Raphson   [15]  root finding scheme is used to solve this problem. A known temperature, $T_i$ is input into Equations 2.2.8 and 2.2.9, along with an initial guess of the unknown hydrogen density, $\\rho_i$ at the known pressure of interest, $P_i$. This guess is used as the central point of a centered finite difference scheme to solve for $\\frac{\\partial \\rho}{\\partial P}$:\n(2.2.10) $$\\frac{\\partial \\rho}{\\partial P} = \\frac{P\\left( \\rho_i+\\Delta \\rho, T_i \\right)+P \\left( \\rho_i-\\Delta \\rho, T_i \\right) } {2\\Delta \\rho} $$ In the above equation, $\\Delta \\rho$ can be any value, provided it is sufficiently small. This model uses $\\Delta \\rho = \\rho_i/1000$.\nNext, the algorithm calculates the pressure associated with the guessed density:\n$$ P_{guess} = P\\left. (\\rho_i, T_i \\right)$$ Using this value, the routine calculates an updated density guess:\n(2.2.11) $$\\rho_{i+1} =\\rho_i + \\frac{\\left(P_{guess}-P_i\\right)} {\\frac{\\partial \\rho}{\\partial P}} $$ This iterative process continues until the change between $\\rho_{i+1}$ and $\\rho_{i}$ converges to within a desired tolerance.\nAn analogous procedure can be used to model temperature as a function of pressure and density. This provides three ways in which to model thermodynamic properties using the Helmholtz correlation:\n(2.2.12) $$\\text{Properties}\\left(\\rho, T \\right) $$  (2.2.13) $$\\text{Properties}\\left(P, T \\right) $$ (2.2.14) $$\\text{Properties}\\left(P, \\rho \\right) $$ To make an acceptable initial guess for initiating these routines, some a priori knowledge about the state of the fluid is required. Fortunately pressure and temperature values along the saturation curves for both hydrogen and oxygen are readily available from the NIST database.  [8]  Pressure along the hydrogen pseudo-boiling line can be calculated from the following equation:  [5] \n(2.2.10) $$ \\frac{P}{P_c}=\\text{exp}\\left(3.098\\,\\left[\\frac{T}{T_c}-1\\right]^{0.849}\\right) $$ The initial density guesses submitted into these Newton-Raphson routines are determined by the phase diagram location corresponding to the station of interest in the engine. If that location falls below the saturation/pseudo-boiling lines, a gaseous solution is required. A “low” density value is submitted as an initial guess. This value is calculated from the ideal gas law (Equation 2.1.2) using the measured temperature and pressure. If the phase diagram location at the station of interest is above the saturation/pseudo-boiling lines, a liquid solution is required. A “high” density typical for liquid hydrogen is submitted as an initial guess.\nThe turbulence displayed in Figures 2.2.1 – 2.2.7 arises when the density solutions returned by the Newton-Raphson scheme fall near the saturation/pseudo-boiling curves. This is a known problem with equations of state that rely on root finding schemes, especially in areas like the pseudo-boiling region where thermodynamic properties exhibit large rates of change.

Equations of State","content":"  MathJax = { tex: {inlineMath: [['$', '$'], ['\\\\(', '\\\\)']]} };  Oxygen Phase Diagram The oxygen phase diagram displays similar trends to those discussed on the hydrogen phase diagram in the previous section. As shown below in Figures 2.3.1. and 2.3.2, a discontinuity in the density field is clearly visible along the saturation line, as expected due to the simultaneous existence of both liquid and gaseous oxygen. This discontinuity gradually smooths out along the pseudo-boiling line above the critical point. The turbulence visible along this line is again due to mathematical difficulties the Newton-Raphson algorithm encounters near the pseudo-boiling line. Along this line the solution is extremely sensitive to small changes in temperature. This makes convergence difficult to achieve.\nFigure 2.3.1  Figure 2.3.2  The critical properties of oxygen plotted in Figure 2.3.2. are as follows:\n$ \\rho_c = \\text{436.1}\\ \\frac{\\text{kg}}{m^3} $ $T_c = \\text{154.6 K}$ $P_c = \\text{5.0 MPa}$ Again, the thermodynamic properties exhibit large rates of change with respect to temperature near the saturation and pseudo-boiling lines. Figure 2.3.3 and 2.3.4 demonstrates this trend for density and specific heat along three different isobars. The largest density gradients occur when approaching the saturation line, and the largest specific heat gradients occur near the pseudo-boiling line.\nFigure 2.3.3  Figure 2.3.4  Figure 2.3.5 (below) shows a contour plot of specific heat over the reduced P-T plane. The mathematical model used to generate this plot imposes a singularity in the $C_p$ field when crossing the pseudo-boiling line. This results in the turbulence visible along this line in the chart below. The $C_p$ field smooths out rapidly to either side, and the model again provides accurate results. This trend is also visible above in Figure 2.3.4. While this discontinuity makes for some less than ideal contour charts, it does clearly illustrate the location of the pseudo-boiling line in the reduced P-T plane.\nFigure 2.3.5  As with hydrogen, the oxygen phase diagram also contains a large region in which the fluid can be modeled accurately by the ideal gas law. This region is shown below in the oxygen compressibility factor chart, Figure 2.3.6. Compressibility factor represents the ratio of the real fluid pressure (accounting for the intermolecular forces significant in liquids) to the pressure that would be exerted by an ideal gas at the same conditions. The ideal gas equation of state holds true when Z=1. Allowing for a 5 percent margin of error, the ideal gas law can be considered applicable in the area where oxygen\u0026rsquo;s compressibility factor falls between 0.95 and 1.05. For oxygen, this region occurs for reduced temperatures greater than 2 and reduced pressures less than 4. Figure 2.3.6 clearly illustrates discontinuities along the pseudo-boiling line, again due to large gradients in the density and specific heat fields. This figure shows that the “quadrants” established by the traditional phase diagram (Figure 2.1.3) do not necessarily correspond to meaningful physical differences in the thermodynamic properties of the fluid.\nFigure 2.3.6  Figure 2.3.7 plots the enthalpy of oxygen across the reduced P-T plane. Notice how for higher temperatures enthalpy becomes a function of temperature alone (nearly independent of pressure). At low temperatures and pressures near the critical point enthalpy is not independent of pressure.\nFigure 2.3.7  Figure 2.3.8 plots the isobaric heat capacity of oxygen as function of reduced density and temperature near the critical point. The labels overlaid on top of this figure correspond to the turbomachinery stations described in Table 1.2.1. This provides a visual representation of how the thermodynamic properties of oxygen change as it flows through the SSME turbomachinery, all the way from the external storage tank to the pre-burner inlets. It is interesting to note that as oxygen flows through the SSME turbomachinery, it remains at a subcritical temperature all the way to the main combustion chamber. Reduced temperatures never rise above the reduced critical temperature (1.0). This is in contrast with hydrogen, where reduced temperatures go well into the supercritical range (up to 10) when flowing through the regenerative cooling circuit. Refer to Figure 2.2.6.\nAnother interesting comparison arises when examining compressibility factors. Although both oxygen and hydrogen flow well into the supercritical pressure range, oxygen\u0026rsquo;s compressibility factor remains fairly close to 1.0 all the way to the main combustion chamber (see Figure 2.3.6 above). Referring back to Table 1.2.1, it is evident that oxygen remains fairly incompressible as it flows through the engine. Its density remains very close to 1130 $\\frac{\\text{kg}}{m^3}$. This is in contrast to hydrogen, where compressibility factors do not fall near the z=1.0 line. This is reflected in the hydrogen densities recorded in Table 1.1.1, which vary from 21 - 70 $\\frac{\\text{kg}}{m^3}$.\nFigure 2.3.8  .tg88 {border-collapse:collapse;border-color:#ccc;border-spacing:0; margin-left:25%; margin-right:25%;} .tg33 td{background-color:#fff;border-color:#ccc;border-style:solid;border-width:1px;color:#333; font-family:Arial, sans-serif;font-size:14px;overflow:hidden;padding:10px 5px;word-break:normal;margin-left:25%;} .tg33 th{background-color:#f0f0f0;border-color:#ccc;border-style:solid;border-width:1px;color:#333; font-family:Arial, sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-weight:normal;overflow:hidden;padding:10px 5px;word-break:normal;} .tg33 .tg-0lax{text-align:left;vertical-align:top}    Station Component $\\frac{P}{P_c}$ $\\frac{T}{T_c}$     $19$ High Pressure Oxidizer Turbopump Inlet 0.6 0.6   $20$ High Pressure Oxidizer Turbopump Exit 5.6 0.7   $25$ Preburner Oxidizer Boost Pump Exit 9.6 0.7   $26$ Oxidizer Preburner O2 Inlet 7.9 0.7    Table 2.3.1  Mathematical Details  The thermodynamic properties of oxygen (pressure, enthalpy, entropy, specific heat, and compressibility factor) are calculated using the same fundamental equations as for hydrogen, Equations 2.2.2 – 2.2.7.

Once again, an implicit method must be used in conjunction with these equations in order model the thermodynamic properties of oxygen as function of temperature and pressure rather than as a function of temperature and density. This is accomplished through use of a Newton-Raphson scheme, as discussed in Section 2.2. The initial density guess used to start the Newton iteration is based on the relative location in the phase diagram with respect to the saturation and pseudo-boiling lines. Pressure and temperature data along the saturation line is readily available from the NIST website. Pressure along the oxygen pseudo-boiling line is modeled by Equation 2.3.10: [5] \n(2.3.10) $$ \\frac{P}{P_c}=\\text{exp}\\left(5.428\\,\\left[\\frac{T}{T_c}-1\\right]\\right) $$ As with hydrogen, the Newton-Raphson scheme does not perform particularly well near the oxygen pseudo-boiling and saturation lines due to the larges rates of change that develop with respect to temperature. This results in the turbulence seen above in Figures 2.3.1-2.3.7. The turbulence quickly smooths out as temperature moves away from either side of these lines.\nPrevious   Next   Top "},{"id":19,"href":"/equation-of-state/2.4-combustion-products/","title":"2.4 Combustion Products","parent":"2.

The hydrogen correlation is accurate within the following limits:[11]\n14 K 7 MPa The oxygen model is even further restricted:[12]\n54 K 0 MPa Propellant temperatures remain in this range as they flow through this SSME’s network of pumps and turbines (refer to Sections 1.1 and 1.2). But temperatures reach up to 3600 K when the propellants mix and react in the pre-burners and main combustion chamber (see Section 1.3). At these high temperatures intermolecular forces may be neglected, and the \u0026ldquo;ideal gas\u0026rdquo; approximation may be used. Additionally, during the combustion process diatomic hydrogen and oxygen disassociate and react to form several different species that must be accounted for: $H$, $O$, $OH$, and $H_2O$ (see Section 3.1). Fortunately, NASA has published a wide range of thermodynamic curve fits applicable to these species at temperatures up to 5000 K.[16] The equations take the following form:\n\n(2.4.1) $$ \\frac{C_p}{R_u} = a_1+a_2\\,T+a_3\\,T^2+a_4\\,T^3+a_5\\,T^4 \\,\\,\\,\\,\\,\\text{[J/(mol K)]} $$ \n(2.4.2) $$ \\frac{h}{R_u\\,T} = a_1+a_2\\frac{T}{2}\\,T+a_3\\frac{T^2}{3}+a_4\\frac{T^3}{4}+a_5\\frac{T^4}{5}+b_1\\,T \\,\\,\\,\\,\\,\\text{[J/(mol)]} $$ \n(2.4.3) $$ \\frac{S}{R_u} = a_1\\,\\text{ln}\\left(T\\right)+a_2\\,T+a_3\\frac{T^2}{2}+a_4\\frac{T^3}{3}+a_5\\frac{T^4}{4} \\,\\,\\,\\,\\,\\text{[J/(mol)]} $$ Coefficients are listed in the following format:\n.tg44 {border-collapse:collapse;border-spacing:0; margin-left:25%; margin-right:25%;} .tg44 td{border-color:black;border-style:solid;border-width:1px;font-family:Arial, sans-serif;font-size:14px; overflow:hidden;padding:10px 20px;word-break:normal;} .tg44 th{border-color:black;border-style:solid;border-width:1px;font-family:Arial, sans-serif;font-size:14px; font-weight:normal;overflow:hidden;padding:10px 20px;word-break:normal;} .tg44 .tg44-fsl0{background-color:#AFE0EF;border-color:inherit;text-align:center;vertical-align:top} .tg44 .tg44-c3ow{border-color:inherit;text-align:center;vertical-align:top} .tg44 .tg44-9sjn{background-color:#FF9F9F;border-color:inherit;text-align:center;vertical-align:top}    a1 a2 a3 a4 a5     b1 b2 a1 a3 a3   a4 a5 b1 b2 -    The coefficients listed in this table establish correlations for two different temperature ranges.

The analysis of SSME combustion products in this section will focus on the gaseous state. The ideal gas law can then be re-arranged to reach the following conclusion:\n(2.5.1) $\\frac{P}{\\rho}\\,=\\,R_s\\,T $ Plugging this expression into Equation 2.1.1 reveals that\n(2.5.2) $h = u + R_s\\,T$ The specific gas constant, $R_s$, is the universal gas constant divided by the molecular mass of the gas molecule. This eliminates the explicit pressure and density terms from the expression for enthalpy. But what about the internal energy, $u$, of the gas? Does pressure play a role here?\nTo answer this question, we need to break down internal energy into four components: translational energy, rotational energy,vibrational energy, and electronic energy.[17]\n(2.5.3) $ u = e_{trans}+ e_{rot}+e_{vib}+e_{elec}$ Translational energy is the result of the molecule moving through space. It is the kinetic energy of the gas molecule, as shown below in Figure 2.5.1.\nFigure 2.5.1[18]  The image above depicts two-dimensional motion of a collection of gas molecules. In reality, a gas molecule is free to translate in three dimensions. It has three degrees of geometric freedom. Statistical thermodynamics can be used to show that each of degree of freedom contributes a factor of $\\left(1/2\\right)R_sT$ to the overall translational energy of the molecule. Summing up these factors for each translational degree of freedom reveals that translational energy is a function of temperature alone:[17].\n(2.5.4) $e_{trans}= \\left(3/2\\right) R_s\\,T$ We now turn our attention to the rotational energy of a molecule, $e_{rot}$. This kinetic energy due to the molecule spinning about its molecular axis, as shown below in Figure 2.5.2.\nFigure 2.5.2[19]  As with translation, the molecule is free to rotate about any of its three spatial axes. It can therefore have up to three rotational degrees of freedom. The exact number of rotational degrees of freedom depends on the geometry of the molecule in question. Monatomic gasses consist simply of a nucleus. There is no defined molecular axis about which they can rotate. Therefore monatomic gasses have no rotational degrees of freedom. A diatomic molecule or linear polyatomic molecule (shown below in Figure 2.5.3) has two rotational degrees of freedom. This is because the moment of inertia along the internuclear axis (X) is negligible compared to the moment of inertia about the two axes perpendicular to it (Y and Z).[17]\nFigure 2.5.3[20]  A non-linear molecule such as $H_2O$ has three rotational degrees of freedom:\nFigure 2.5.4[21]  Each degree of rotational freedom (the number of which varies depending on the geometry described above) contributes $\\frac{1}{2}RT$ to the total amount of rotational energy in the gas. Again, this result is independent of pressure.\nWe now look at the molecule\u0026rsquo;s vibrational energy. Many different degrees of vibrational freedom may exist. Several examples are shown below.\nFigure 2.5.4:Possible Vibration Modes [22]  To account for these vibrational modes, scientists performed experiments to measure the harmonic frequency of many different species. Vibration frequencies relevant to SSME combustion gasses are tabulated below:[23]\n.tg55 {border-collapse:collapse;border-spacing:0;margin-left:25%; margin-right:25%;} .tg55 td{border-color:black;border-style:solid;border-width:1px;font-family:Arial, sans-serif;font-size:14px; overflow:hidden;padding:10px 5px;word-break:normal;} .tg55 th{border-color:black;border-style:solid;border-width:1px;font-family:Arial, sans-serif;font-size:14px; font-weight:normal;overflow:hidden;padding:10px 5px;word-break:normal;} .tg55 .tg55-c3ow{border-color:inherit;text-align:center;vertical-align:top} .t55g .tg55-7btt{border-color:inherit;font-weight:bold;text-align:center;vertical-align:top}    Species Harmonic Frequency $\\left(cm^{-1}\\right)$     $H_2$ 4401.2   $O_2$ 1580.2   $H_2O$ (Mode\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;1) 3832.2   $H_2O$ (Mode\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;2) 1648.5   $H_2O$ (Mode\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;3) 3942.5   $O$ 0   $H$ 0    Table 2.5.1  These frequencies, $v$, can be used to calculate the overall vibrational energy contained within the gas. The following equation is applicable to a diatomic molecule. Similar equations exist for polyatomic molecules, but analysis becomes increasingly complex as multiple vibrational modes must be accounted for, as in the case of $H_2O$. Vibrational energy can be neglected in monatomic gasses such as $O$ and $H$.[17]\n(2.5.5) $$ e_{vib}= \\frac{\\frac{h\\,v\\,c}{k\\,T}}{\\text{exp}\\left(\\frac{h\\,v\\,c}{kT} \\right)-1}\\,R_s\\,T $$  $ h=6.62607 \\times 10^{-34}\\,\\,\\,\\,\\,\\,\\,\\,\\,\\,\\, $ Planck's Constant $\\,\\,[J\\,Hz^{-1}]$  $ k=1.380649 \\times 10^{-23}\\,\\,\\,\\,\\,\\,\\,\\,\\,\\,\\, $ Boltzman’s Constant $\\,\\,[J/K]$  $ c=2.99792458 \\times 10^{10}\\,\\,\\,\\,\\,\\,\\,\\,\\,\\,\\, $ Speed of light $\\,\\,[cm/s]$  Equation 2.5.5. shows that the vibrational energy of an ideal gas is independent of pressure. It is a function of temperature alone.\nFinally, we turn to the electronic energy of the gas. This energy is due to electron configuration within the molecule\u0026rsquo;s orbitals. As temperature increases, electrons transition from ground state orbitals to enter an \u0026ldquo;excited state,\u0026rdquo; which increases the internal energy of the gas.\nFigure 2.5.5[24]  Electronic excitation is a complicated process to model. We must turn to an electronic partition function, Q:\n(2.5.6) $$ Q=\\sum_i^{\\infty}g_i\\text{exp}\\left( \\frac{-\\epsilon_i}{kT}\\right) $$  The coefficients $g_i$ and $\\epsilon_i$ describe electron configuration within the molecule\u0026rsquo;s orbitals. $g_i$ represents the degeneracy of the configuration. Degeneracy accounts for the possibility of multiple electron orientations within the same quantized energy level. $\\epsilon_i$ is the total amount of energy contained within the level of interest. These coefficients are not easy to calculate. They are generally determined by spectroscopic measurement. Refer to [25], [26], and [27].\nFortunately we do not need to perform a summation over an infinite number of electronic energy levels as Equation 2.5.6 seems to suggest. Referring back to Figure 2.5.5, it can be seen that the largest increase in the electronic energy of a gas occurs during transition from the ground state to the first excited state. The amount of energy gained in subsequent transitions lessens with each jump. Generally speaking, this means that the high-order terms Equation 2.5.6 can neglected, especially when modeling relatively low temperatures. Reasonably accurate results can be obtained using the degeneracy and energy coefficients corresponding to the first transition above ground state. For this example we will examine the first ground state transition of diatomic oxygen ($g_0 =3$, $g_1 =2$, and $\\epsilon_0=0$, $\\epsilon_1=-1.57\\times10^{-19})$.\nAfter plugging these coefficients in to Equation 2.5.6 one more step is required to complete the energy calculation:\n(2.5.7) $$ e_{elec} = R_s\\,T^2\\,\\frac{\\partial\\,\\text{ln}\\left(Q \\right)}{\\partial\\,T} $$  We are now finally equipped to analyze all contributions to the internal energy of a diatomic ideal gas. Summing the translational, rotational, vibrational, and electronic energy components reveals:\n(2.5.8) $$ u = \\frac{3}{2} R_s\\,T + R_s\\,T+ \\,R_s\\,T \\,\\frac{\\frac{h\\,v\\,c}{k\\,T}}{\\text{exp}\\left(\\frac{h\\,v\\,c}{kT} \\right)-1}+ R_s\\,T^2\\,\\frac{\\partial\\,\\text{ln}\\left(Q \\right)}{\\partial\\,T} $$  This result definitively shows that the the internal energy and enthalpy of an ideal gas are independent of pressure. They are functions of temperature alone. This trend is demonstrated in the plot below. The plot shows that the enthalpy of diatomic oxygen is independent of pressure for temperatures greater than approximately 1.25 Tc. Above this temperature, the “real gas” effects due to intermolecular forces may be neglected and the “ideal gas” approximations described in this section are valid. Near the critical point (where reduced pressure and temperature = 1) a “real gas” equation of state (i.e. the Helmholtz model from Section 2.1) must be used to account for the effects of pressure and intermolecular forces.\nFigure 2.5.6  We now have an explicit equation for the internal energy of an ideal gas as a function of temperature alone. This enables some interesting calculations to be made. The isochoric heat capacity of an ideal gas is defined as the rate of change of internal energy with respect to temperature:[28]\n(2.5.9) $$ C_v = \\frac{\\partial\\,u}{\\partial\\,T} $$  Isobaric heat capacity can then be solved for with aid of Equation 2.5.10:\n(2.5.10) $$ C_p = R_s + C_v$$  For an ideal gas, enthalpy can be modeled by the following differential equation:\n(2.5.11) $$ dh=C_p\\,dT $$  solving this equation for $h$ reveals that:\n\n(2.5.12) $$ h = \\int\\,C_p\\,dT + c $$  where $c$ is an arbitrary constant of integration. This is a surprising result. Depending on the value chosen for $c$, Equation 2.5.12 will return different values for enthalpy. How do we go about selecting the correct constant of integration? We solve this problem by imposing a Dirichlet boundary condition on Equation 2.5.11:\n$$ h\\left(T_{ref}\\right) = h_{ref} $$  Any convenient reference temperature ($T_{ref}$) and reference enthalpy ($h_{ref}$) can be selected. The analysis used in this model of the SSME sets a reference temperature of 298.5 K and a corresponding reference enthalpy of zero: h(298.5)= 0.\nCare must be taken when comparing enthalpies tabulated across different sources. Each source may report a different enthalpy value even when comparing identical temperatures. The enthalpies tabulated below illustrate this trend.\n.tg66 {border-collapse:collapse;border-spacing:0;margin-left:25%; margin-right:25%;} .tg td{border-color:black;border-style:solid;border-width:1px;font-family:Arial, sans-serif;font-size:14px; overflow:hidden;padding:10px 5px;word-break:normal;} .tg th{border-color:black;border-style:solid;border-width:1px;font-family:Arial, sans-serif;font-size:14px; font-weight:normal;overflow:hidden;padding:10px 5px;word-break:normal;} .tg .tg-c3ow{border-color:inherit;text-align:center;vertical-align:top} .tg .tg-7btt{border-color:inherit;font-weight:bold;text-align:center;vertical-align:top}    $O_2$\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;Enthalpy (kJ/mol)     T (K) NIST[29] JANAF[30] NASA[31]   250 11.527 -1.41 7.25984   300 12.994 0.054 8.72704    Table 2.5.2  We seem to be at an impasse. No two sources seem to agree on the correct enthalpy value. But an interesting result arises when you compare the difference between enthalpies at two different temperatures. The following table shows h(300)-h(250) values for each source:\n.tg66 {border-collapse:collapse;border-spacing:0; margin-left:30%; margin-right:25%;} .tg td{border-color:black;border-style:solid;border-width:1px;font-family:Arial, sans-serif;font-size:14px; overflow:hidden;padding:10px 5px;word-break:normal;} .tg th{border-color:black;border-style:solid;border-width:1px;font-family:Arial, sans-serif;font-size:14px; font-weight:normal;overflow:hidden;padding:10px 5px;word-break:normal;} .tg .tg-bobw{font-weight:bold;text-align:center;vertical-align:bottom} .tg .tg-wa1i{font-weight:bold;text-align:center;vertical-align:middle} .tg .tg-8d8j{text-align:center;vertical-align:bottom}    $O_2$\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;Enthalpy (kJ/mol)      NIST JANAF NASA   h(300)-h(250) 1.467 1.464 1.4672    Table 2.5.3  Notice how all three references are in excellent agreement on the difference between h(300) and h(250). This makes it clear that the constant of integration chosen for Equation 2.5.12 is truly arbitrary. Enthalpy does not make sense without comparison to a reference value. It is the difference in the amount of energy contained by an ideal gas at two different temperatures.\nNow we return to the empirical correlations introduced in Section 2.4:\n(2.4.1) $$ \\frac{C_p}{R_u} = a_1+a_2\\,T+a_3\\,T^2+a_4\\,T^3+a_5\\,T^4 \\,\\,\\,\\,\\,\\text{[J/(mol K)]} $$ (2.4.2) $$ \\frac{h}{R_u\\,T} = a_1+a_2\\frac{T}{2}\\,T+a_3\\frac{T^2}{3}+a_4\\frac{T^3}{4}+a_5\\frac{T^4}{5}+b_1\\,T \\,\\,\\,\\,\\,\\text{[J/(mol)]} $$ These equation are polynomials that have been fit to experimental data. We now have the tools to compare these experimental curve fits to the theoretical models derived above.\nFigure 2.5.7:  Comparison of $C_p$ models for diatomic oxygen.  Figure 2.5.8:  Comparison of enthalpy models for diatomic oxygen.  The plots above show that the experimental results are in excellent agreement with the results predicted by statistical thermodynamics. The theoretical specific heat model begins to diverge slightly as temperature increases. It under predicts $C_p$ due to early truncation of the electronic partition function. Additional accuracy could be gained by including additional terms in Equation 2.5.6.\nAnother interesting result becomes evident upon analyzing the reduced isochoric heat capacity ($C_v/R_s$) predicted by the theoretical model. The plot below shows that the reduced heat capacity converges to a value of 2.5 at low temperatures.\nFigure 2.5.9:  Comparison of $C_p$ models for diatomic oxygen.  This makes physical sense. At low temperatures only the translational and rotational energy modes are active. The vibrational and electronic terms in Equation 2.5.8 can be neglected, and the equation for internal energy reduces to\n$$ u = \\frac{5}{2}R_S\\,T$$  Differentiating this eqation with respect to temperature reveals that\n$$ \\frac{C_v}{R_s} = \\frac{5}{2} = 2.5 $$  Figures 2.5.7 and 2.5.9 demonstrate that at low temperatures the specific heat of an ideal gas is constant. Enthalpy and internal energy are functions of temperature alone. The specific heat ratio, $\\gamma = \\frac{C_p}{C_v}$ is constant, and the ideal gas equation of state is valid. A gas obeying these rules is described as \u0026ldquo;calorically perfect\u0026rdquo;. A familiar result from the \u0026ldquo;calorically perfect\u0026rdquo; assumption is that for air, $\\gamma= 1.4$.\nAs temperature increases, specific heat starts to change and $\\gamma$ is no longer constant. It becomes a function of temperature, along with enthalpy and internal energy. The ideal gas equation of state still holds true. A gas obeying these rules is described as \u0026ldquo;thermally perfect.\u0026rdquo;\nAt low temperatures the ideal gas approximations used in this section break down. Specific heat, enthalpy, and internal energy become functions of temperature and pressure due to the increasing importance of intermolecular forces. This is a \u0026ldquo;real gas\u0026rdquo; that can no longer be modeled with the ideal gas law. A real gas equation of state (such as the Helmholtz correlation) must be used instead.\nPrevious   Next   Top "},{"id":21,"href":"/equation-of-state/2.6-transport-properties/","title":"2.6 Transport Properties","parent":"2.  Equations of State","content":"  MathJax = { tex: {inlineMath: [['$', '$'], ['\\\\(', '\\\\)']]} };  Transport Properties The equations of state discussed in the previous sections enabled us to calculate the thermodynamic properties of hydrogen, oxygen, and their associated combustion products. We now direct our attention to the transport properties of these propellants. Transport properties describe how a fluid disperses energy. There are two properties of interest: thermal conductivity and viscosity. Thermal conductivity describes a fluid’s ability to transfer heat via conduction. Viscosity represents the fluid’s response to shear stress and the resulting transfer of momentum.\nOnce again the model must be divided into two regimes: a low temperature regime for liquid propellants, and a high temperature regime for combustion gasses.\nLiquid Hydrogen Thermal Conductivity The liquid hydrogen thermal conductivity model is split into three terms: the dilute gas component $\\lambda_0$, the \u0026ldquo;excess\u0026rdquo; conductivity $\\Delta\\lambda$, and the critical enhancement $\\Delta\\lambda_c$. The dilute gas component is a theoretical construct representing the thermal conductivity of the fluid at zero density. The excess conductivity term takes into account effects of variable density. At times, the excess component and the dilute gas component are bundled together in a term known as the \u0026ldquo;background\u0026rdquo; conductivity.[32] The critical enhancement takes into account density fluctuations occurring near the critical point that lead to a singularity in the thermal conductivity field. Equations for all three terms are listed below.[33]\n(2.6.1) $$\\lambda_0 = \\frac{\\sum_{i=0}^m\\,A_{1,i}\\left(T/T_c\\right)^i}{\\sum_{i=0}^n\\,A_{2,i}\\left(T/T_c\\right)^i} $$ (2.6.2) $$\\Delta\\lambda = \\sum_{i=1}^5\\left(B_{1,i}+B_{2,i}\\left(T/T_c\\right)\\right)\\left(\\rho/\\rho_c\\right)^i$$ (2.6.3) $$\\Delta\\lambda_c =\\frac{C_1}{C_2+|\\Delta\\,T_c|}\\,\\text{exp}\\left[-\\left(C_3\\,\\Delta\\rho_c\\right)^2\\right] $$ (2.6.4) $$\\lambda_{total} = \\lambda_0+\\Delta\\lambda+\\Delta\\lambda_c $$ $C_1=6.24\\times10^{-4}$ $C_2=-2.58\\times10^{-7}$ $C_3=0.837$ $T_c= 32.938 K $ $\\rho_c= 31.323 \\frac{kg}{m^3}$ $\\Delta\\rho_c=\\frac{\\rho}{\\rho_c}-1$ $\\Delta T_c=\\frac{T}{T_c}-1$ Coefficients for these equations are listed in the following table.\nParahydrogen Coefficients  .tg {border-collapse:collapse;border-spacing:0;margin:0px auto;} .tg td{border-color:black;border-style:solid;border-width:1px;font-family:Arial, sans-serif;font-size:14px; overflow:hidden;padding:10px 5px;word-break:normal;} .tg th{border-color:black;border-style:solid;border-width:1px;font-family:Arial, sans-serif;font-size:14px; font-weight:normal;overflow:hidden;padding:10px 5px;word-break:normal;} .tg .tg-c3ow{border-color:inherit;text-align:center;vertical-align:top} .tg .tg-7btt{border-color:inherit;font-weight:bold;text-align:center;vertical-align:top}      i $A_1$ $A_2$ $B_1$ $B_2$     0 -1.24500E+00 1.42304E+04 2.65975E-02 -1.21727E-03   1 3.10212E+02 -1.93922E+04 -1.33826E-03 3.66663E-03   2 -3.31004E+02 1.58379E+04 1.30219E-02 3.88715E-03   3 2.46016E+02 -4.81812E+03 -5.67678E-03 -9.21055E-03   4 -6.57810E+01 7.28639E+02 -9.23380E-05 4.00723E-03   5 1.08260E+01 -3.57365E+01 - -   6 -5.19659E-01 1.00000E+00 - -   7 1.439790E-02 - - -     Normal Hydrogen Coefficients  .tg {border-collapse:collapse;border-spacing:0;margin:0px auto;} .tg td{border-color:black;border-style:solid;border-width:1px;font-family:Arial, sans-serif;font-size:14px; overflow:hidden;padding:10px 5px;word-break:normal;} .tg th{border-color:black;border-style:solid;border-width:1px;font-family:Arial, sans-serif;font-size:14px; font-weight:normal;overflow:hidden;padding:10px 5px;word-break:normal;} .tg .tg-ljam{border-color:#000000;text-align:center;vertical-align:bottom} .tg .tg-jdb5{border-color:#000000;font-weight:bold;text-align:center;vertical-align:bottom}      i $A_1$ $A_2$ $B_1$ $B_2$     0 -3.40976E-01 1.38497E+02 3.63081E-02 1.83370E-03   1 4.58820E+00 -2.21878E+01 -2.07629E-02 -8.86716E-03   2 -1.45080E+00 4.57151E+00 3.14810E-02 1.58260E-02   3 3.26394E-01 1.00000E+00 -1.43097E-02 -1.06283E-02   4 3.16939E-03 - 1.74980E-03 2.80673E-03   5 1.90592E-04 - - -   6 -1.13900E-06 - - -      Table 2.6.1 Equations 2.6.2 and 2.6.3 present a challenge. Both of these equations are functions of density. It is fairly straight forward to measure the temperature and pressure of liquid hydrogen flowing through a rocket engine. Just attach a thermocouple and pressure transducer to a pipeline and the collect the data. But there is no simple instrumentation available to measure density. Instead, density must be calculated from an equation of state using a measured temperature and pressure. This can be accomplished using the Helmholtz correlation discussed in Section 2.2.\nThe final hurdle to overcome is the question posed by the two sets of coefficients in Table 2.6.1. Should we use the data for parahydrogen or normal hydrogen? It is important to note that \u0026ldquo;normal\u0026rdquo; hydrogen is actually a mixture consisting of 75% orthohydrogen and 25% parahydrogen. This composition varies as a function of temperature (see Figure 2.2.8) There are really two issues at hand. First, we need to determine the conductivity of orthohydrogen at the desired temperature and pressure. Second, we need to calculate the overall conductivity of the mixture, taking in to account that the para/ortho composition is a function of temperature.\nThe first issue is resolved by performing the thermal conductivity calculation utilizing both sets of coefficients in Table 2.6.1 to solve for $\\lambda_{norm}$ and $\\lambda_{para}$. The next step is to solve for $\\lambda_{ortho}$ with Equation 2.6.5:\n(2.6.5) $$\\lambda_{ortho} = \\frac{\\lambda_{norm}-0.25\\lambda_{para}}{0.75} $$ Now the total conductivity of the mixture can be determined by taking in to account ortho/para composition at the desired temperature:\n(2.6.6) $$\\lambda_{tot} = X\\,\\lambda_{para}+\\left(1-X\\right)\\lambda_{ortho} $$ The variable $X$ represents the fraction of parahydrogen in the mixture, as shown in Figure 2.2.8. These equations allow the thermal conductivity surface to be calculated. The model is accurate for temperatures up to 1000 K and pressures up to 100 MPa. The figure below plots thermal conductivity as a function of reduced pressure and reduced temperature.\nFigure 2.6.1  There are two interesting items to note on Figure 2.6.1. First, the model does not perform particularly well near the critical point where $\\text{P}_r=1$ and $\\text{T}_r =1$. In fact, the model diverges along the critical temperature isotherm. This is an inherent feature of the model.[33] Secondly, since this model relies on a density calculation performed with the Helmholtz equation of state (see Section 2.2), it introduces turbulence along the saturation and pseudo-boiling lines. This turbulence is visible in Figure 2.6.1 in the region where reduced temperature is between 1 and 1.5. This is a known problem with equations of state that rely on root finding schemes based on temperature and pressure inputs, especially in areas like the pseudo-boiling region where thermodynamic properties exhibit large rates of change.[34] Fortunately, the vast majority of the thermal conductivity calculations required for this model of the SSME occur at reduced pressures of 25 to 30, far above the turbulent region.\nLiquid Hydrogen Viscosity The liquid hydrogen viscosity model is split into similar terms as the thermal conductivity model. A dilute gas component, $\\eta_0$ corresponds to conductivity at the low density limit. The excess viscosity, $\\Delta\\eta$, accounts for the effects of variable density. At low densities, the excess viscosity is independent of temperature. The total viscosity is the sum of the dilute gas and excess components. This correlation does not include a critical enhancement.[35]\n(2.6.7) $$\\eta_0=8.5558\\left(\\frac{T^{3/2}}{T+19.55}\\right)\\left(\\frac{T+650.39}{T+1175.9}\\right) $$ (2.6.8) $$\\Delta\\eta = A\\,\\text{exp}\\left(\\frac{B}{T}\\right) $$ (2.6.9) $$ \\eta_{tot}=\\left(\\eta_0+\\Delta\\,\\eta\\right)\\times10^{-7} $$ The coefficients $A$ and $B$ are described by the following equations:\n(2.6.10) $$ \\text{ln}\\left(A\\right)=5.7694+\\text{ln}\\left(\\rho\\right)+65\\,\\rho^{\\frac{3}{2}}-\\,\\left(6\\times10^{-6}\\right)\\,\\text{exp}\\left(127.2\\,\\rho\\right)$$ (2.6.11) $$ B=10+7.2\\left[\\left(\\frac{\\rho}{0.07}\\right)^{6}-\\left(\\frac{\\rho}{0.07}\\right)^{\\frac{3}{2}}\\right]-17.63\\,\\,\\text{exp}\\left[-58.75\\left(\\frac{\\rho}{0.07}\\right)^{3}\\right] $$ This correlation is again a function of density, which must be input with units of $g/cm^3$. The resulting viscosity is then output with units of $Pa \\cdot sec$. As was the case for thermal conductivity, and equation of state must be used to determine density for input into Equations 2.6.8 and 2.6.9. The resulting viscosity surface again contains turbulence along the pseudo-boiling line due to instability with the root finding algorithm used in this region.\nFigure 2.6.2  Combustion Gas Transport Properties Transport properties of the high-temperature gasses produced in the SSME pre-burners and main combustion chamber are modeled with empirical curve fits. The equations take the following form:\n\n(2.6.12) $$ \\text{ln}\\left(\\lambda\\right)=\\,A\\,\\text{ln}\\left(T\\right)+\\frac{B}{T}+\\frac{C}{T^2}+D$$ \n(2.6.13) $$ \\text{ln}\\left(\\eta\\right)=\\,A\\,\\text{ln}\\left(T\\right)+\\frac{B}{T}+\\frac{C}{T^2}+D$$ Once again, the coefficients for these curve fits come from data tabulated in NASA Technical Memorandum 4513.[16] Temperature is entered in kelvin. Viscosity is output in units of micropoise, and thermal conductivity in microwatts per centimeter kelvin.

But the gas produced in the SSME pre-burners and main combustion chamber consists of a mixture of all these species. The model must be adjusted to account for the resulting composition. In the case of thermodynamic properties calculated in Section 2.4, a simple mixture rule is utilized where the properties are weighted according to mole fraction alone. A slightly more complex model is required for the transport properties:[36]\n(2.6.14) $$ \\eta_{mix}=\\sum_{i=1}^6\\frac{x_i\\,\\eta_i}{x_i+\\sum_{j=1, j\\neq i}^6\\,x_j\\,\\phi_{ij}}$$ (2.6.15) $$ \\lambda_{mix}=\\sum_{i=1}^6\\frac{x_i\\,\\eta_i}{x_i+\\sum_{j=1, j\\neq i}^6\\,x_j\\,\\psi_{ij}}$$ (2.6.16) $$\\phi_{ij}=\\frac{1}{4}\\left[1+\\left(\\frac{\\eta_i}{\\eta_j}\\right)^{1/2}\\left(\\frac{M_j}{M_i}\\right)^{1/4}\\right]^2\\,\\left(\\frac{2\\,M_j}{M_i+M_j}\\right)^{1/2} $$ (2.6.17) $$\\psi_{ij}=\\phi_{ij}\\left[1+\\frac{2.41\\left(M_i-M_j\\right)\\left(M_i-0.142\\,M_j\\right)}{\\left(M_i+M_j\\right)^2}\\right] $$ In the above equations, $M$ is the molecular mass of an individual species. This model of the SSME utilizes the six species listed in Tables 2.6.2 and 2.6.3, hence the summations on $i$ and $j$ go up to six. The variable $x$ represents the mole fraction of each individual species within the overall gas mixture. Mole fractions are calculated utilizing the combustion model presented in Section 3.\nFigures 2.6.4 and 2.6.5 plot the thermal conductivity and viscosity of the SSME exhaust as a function of axial position in the main combustion chamber and rocket nozzle. As expected, the transport properties mirror the trend displayed by the exhaust temperature, as shown in Figure 2.6.3. Properties are the highest in the main combustion chamber where temperatures reach approximately 3600 K. Exhaust temperature rapidly decreases along the length of the nozzle. Transport properties follow this trend.\nFigure 2.6.3: Exhaust Temperature Profile  Figure 2.6.4: Thermal Conductivity Profile  Figure 2.6.5 Viscosity Profile  As a final note, this model assumes the exhaust flow is \u0026ldquo;frozen.\u0026rdquo; This means that exhaust composition is fixed in the combustion chamber. Mole fractions are assumed to remain constant as the gas flows through the nozzle. In reality, the exhaust composition changes as a function of temperature and pressure due to the individual species recombining via chemical reactions. A flow like this is described as an \u0026ldquo;equilibrium\u0026rdquo; flow. If the exhaust temperature profile shown in Figure 2.6.3 included the effects of chemical equilibrium, temperatures and transport properties would slightly higher than what is currently shown.[17]\nPrevious   Next   Top "},{"id":22,"href":"/thermodynamic-data/1.2-oxidizer-system/","title":"1.2 Oxidizer System","parent":"1.

This pump raises the pressure of the incoming fluid to a modest level before routing it to the High Pressure Oxidizer Turbopump (HPOTP) at Station 19 where the pressure is raised to a level suitable for combustion.\nAfter departing the HPOTP at Station 20, the flow splits into two branches. The first branch (Branch “D”) runs directly to the Large Throat Main Combustion Chamber (LTMCC) inlet at Station 21. Just prior to reaching this station, the flow splits off (Branch “E”) and returns toward the Preburner Oxidizer Boost Pump (Station 24). This pump is mounted directly beneath the HPOTP and is used to pressurize the oxygen to a level appropriate for entry into the Oxidizer Preburner oxygen inlet (Station 26) and the Fuel Preburner oxygen inlet (Station 27).\nThe second branch departing the HPOTP at Station 20 (Branch “F”) flows to the Low Pressure Oxidizer Turbine Inlet (Station 22). This turbine drives the Low Pressure Oxidizer Turbopump, thus sustaining the overall mass flow rate of liquid oxygen into the system. Flow departs the Low Pressure Oxidizer Turbine at Station 23 and mixes with the outflow from the Low Pressure Oxidizer Turbopump at Station 18.\nStation 28 represents the small quantity of oxygen that is routed back to the external oxygen tank as an ullage pressurant.\nTable 1.2.1 displays several key thermodynamic properties of the flow as it progresses through these stations. The mass flow rates, temperatures, and pressures listed below were tabulated from Reference [2].

This causes the turbine blades to spin, which in turn causes the rotors in the High Pressure Oxidizer Turbopump and the Preburner Oxidizer Booster Pump to spin due to their mechanical linkage. This process powers the entire SSME Oxidizer System.\nAfter departing the high pressure turbines at Stations 30 and 32, the resulting gas mixtures are routed to the Large Throat Main Combustion Chamber (LTMCC) at Station 33 . It is important to note that the gas mixture entering the LTMCC consists of approximately 90% hydrogen by mole fraction. This composition contains sufficient hydrogen to combust yet again when combined with the oxygen flowing in to the LTMCC from the powerhead. The resulting chemical reaction creates a gas mixture at 6000 °F that is approximately 65% water vapor by mole fraction. This mixture accelerates through the throat and down the nozzle, trading its thermal energy for kinetic energy. By the time the gas reaches the nozzle exit plane at Station 34, it has accelerated to Mach 4.54 which enables the SSME to produce approximately 490,000 pounds of thrust (in vacuum conditions).\nTable 1.3 displays several key thermodynamic properties of the flow as it progresses through these stations. The mass flow rates, temperatures, and pressures listed below were tabulated from Reference [2]. Densities and enthalpies were calculated utilizing combustion model described in Section 2.4, and the turbine model described in Section 4.2. “Frozen flow” is assumed for combustion product composition. (i.e. composition remains fixed after combustion is complete).\nOverall SSME Performance Data  .tg2 {border-collapse:collapse;border-spacing:0;margin-left:30%; margin-right:30%;} .tg2 td{border-color:black;border-style:solid;border-width:1px;font-family:Arial, sans-serif;font-size:14px; overflow:hidden;padding:10px 5px;word-break:normal;} .tg2 th{border-color:black;border-style:solid;border-width:1px;font-family:Arial, sans-serif;font-size:14px; font-weight:normal;overflow:hidden;padding:10px 5px;word-break:normal;} .tg2 .tg2-zqao{background-color:#FDFB93;border-color:#000000;font-weight:bold;text-align:center;vertical-align:middle} .tg2 .tg2-6dvz{background-color:#FDFB93;border-color:#000000;text-align:center;vertical-align:middle}     Sea Level Vacuum     Nozzle Exit Velocity [m/s] 4311 4311   Thrust [lb] 398,400 491,900   Specific Impulse [s] 366 452    \nSI Units  .tg {border-collapse:collapse;border-spacing:0;} .tg td{border-color:black;border-style:solid;border-width:1px;font-family:Arial, sans-serif;font-size:14px; overflow:hidden;padding:10px 5px;word-break:normal;} .tg th{border-color:black;border-style:solid;border-width:1px;font-family:Arial, sans-serif;font-size:14px; font-weight:normal;overflow:hidden;padding:10px 5px;word-break:normal;} .tg .tg-zqao{background-color:#FDFB93;border-color:#000000;font-weight:bold;text-align:center;vertical-align:middle} .tg .tg-qzll{background-color:#FDFB93;border-color:#000000;text-align:center;vertical-align:bottom}    Station Component Mass Flow $kg/sec$ Temp $K$ Pressure $MPa$ Density $kg/m^3$ Enthalpy $kJ/kg$     29 Fuel Preburner 65.7 983 33.05 15.06 -1496   30 High Pressure Fuel Turbine Exit 68.0 859 22.03 6.68 -2346   31 Oxidizer Preburner 30.8 739 33.18 17.65 -1708   32 High Pressure Oxidizer Turbine Exit 30.8 660 21.37 8.82 -2366   33* Large Throat Main Combustion Chamber (Throat Stagnation Conditions)* 492.1 3589 19.79 8.64 -260   34 Nozzle Exit 492.1 1150 0.02 0.027 -8743    *33: The pressure listed in this table is the is the \"throat stagnation pressure\" reported by Boeing in Reference [2].

This website establishes a computational model to trace the thermodynamic properties of these propellants as they flow through the components of the SSME. The overall results of this analysis are presented in Section 1. Section 2 contains all of the mathematical background required to predict the thermodynamic states of liquid hydrogen, liquid oxygen, and their associated high-temperature combustion products without relying on expensive commercial software like NIST RefProp. Section 3 provides all of the resources necessary to code an $H_2/O_2$ combustion model that produces results very comparable to NASA\u0026rsquo;s Chemical Equilibrium With Applications (CEA) program. Section 4 builds upon these results to predict the mass flow rates and power required to drive the SSME\u0026rsquo;s network of turbomachinery. Sections 5 and 6 describe a procedure for conducting a coupled heat transfer analysis in the SSME regenerative cooling circuit, similar to NASA\u0026rsquo;s Rocket Thermal Evaluation (RTE)[87] and Two Dimensional Kinetics (TDK)[88] codes.\nThe results of the model developed here predict the SSME\u0026rsquo;s specific impulse, thrust, and maximum hot-wall temperatures to within 2% of values reported by Boeing and Rocketdyne. This model does not rely on any commercial Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) software, and converges to a solution on a modest single-core processor in less than 30 seconds.\nNext   Top "},{"id":34,"href":"/tags/","title":"Tags","parent":"Space Shuttle Main Engine Computational Model","content":""}]
